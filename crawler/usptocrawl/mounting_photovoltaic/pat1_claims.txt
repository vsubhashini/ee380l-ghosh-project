Claims What is claimed is: 1. A photovoltaic module mounting system comprising: a plurality of photovoltaic cells positioned between a transparent module layer and a backside module layer, wherein the transparent module layer has an upper surface and the backside module layer has a lower surface; at least one mounting bracket in contact with the upper surface and the lower surface of the module inside of the distance between the ends of the module, wherein the mounting bracket is configured to resist pullout forces inplane with the plane of the module and the bracket is configured to hold the module flat in a horizontal plane until a threshold pressure is reached upon which the bracket allows for motion in one degree of freedom such that the module deflects in a pre-determined mode of deflection, wherein the threshold pressure is at least 500 psi. 2. The module mounting system of claim 1 wherein the module is a frameless module. 3. The module mounting system of claim 1 wherein the bracket is configured to allow for rotation of the module in one degree of freedom while still resisting pullout forces inplane with the plane of the module. 4. The module mounting system of claim 1 wherein the bracket is configured to allow only for upward rotation of the module in one degree of freedom while still resisting pullout forces inplane with the plane of the module. 5. The module mounting system of claim 1 wherein the bracket is configured to allow only for downward rotation of the module in one degree of freedom while still resisting pullout forces inplane with the plane of the module. 6. The module mounting system of claim 1 wherein the bracket is configured to allow the module to flex in one axis. 7. The module mounting system of claim 1 wherein the threshold pressure is 500 psi. 8. The module mounting system of claim 1 wherein the threshold pressure is 1/8 of the module stress concentration till failure. 9. The module mounting system of claim 1 wherein the bracket comprises an internal rotatable portion attached to the module and a stationary housing within which the rotatable portion can be rotated in one degree of freedom. 10. The module mounting system of claim 1 wherein at least one portion of the bracket comprises a polymer and rotation in one degree of freedom is achieved through deformation of the polymer. 11. The module mounting system of claim 1 wherein the mode of deflection only allows for bending about a long axis of the module. 12. A photovoltaic module mounting system comprising: a plurality of photovoltaic cells positioned between a transparent module layer and a backside module layer, wherein the transparent module layer has an upper surface and the backside module layer has a lower surface; at least one mounting bracket in contact with the upper surface and the lower surface of the module inside of the distance between the ends of the module, wherein the mounting bracket is configured to resist pullout forces inplane with the plane of the module and the bracket is configured to hold the module flat in a horizontal plane until a threshold pressure is reached upon which the bracket allows for motion in one degree of freedom such that the module deflects in a pre-determined mode of deflection, wherein the threshold pressure is at least 1/8 of the module stress concentration till failure.
