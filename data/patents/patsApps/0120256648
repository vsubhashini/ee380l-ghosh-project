Embodiments of the present invention describe an apparatus including an oscillator, a ramp generator, and an inverter. The oscillator is configured to generate a waveform comprising a low time and a high time. The inverter is configured to receive the waveform generated by the oscillator, and invert the waveform. The ramp generator is configured to increase a gate control voltage of a transistor connected to a solar cell, and rapidly decrease the gate control voltage of the transistor. During the low time, a measurement of a current and a voltage of the solar cell is performed. During the high time, a measurement of a current of a shorted cell and a voltage reference is performed.



1. An apparatus for in-situ monitoring of solar cells, comprising: an oscillator that generates a waveform comprising a low time and a high time; an inverter that receives the waveform generated by the oscillator, and inverts the waveform; and a ramp generator that increases a gate control voltage of a transistor connected to a solar cell, and then rapidly decreases the gate control voltage of the transistor, wherein, during the low time of the waveform, a measurement of a current and a voltage of the solar cell is performed as the current and voltage of the solar cell are transmitted through a first channel and to a second channel, and wherein, during the high time of the waveform, a measurement of a current of a shorted solar cell and a voltage reference is performed as the current of the shorted solar cell and the voltage reference are transmitted through the first channel and the second channel.
