A solar module connector comprising: a cable; a housing having a mounting surface at least a portion of which partially defines an opening for facilitating contact with at least one buss lead of a solar module, a cavity, a cable end, and a passageway between the cavity and the cable end; a seal disposed around the cable and at least partially seated in the passageway; and a contact electrically connected to the cable and disposed in the cavity proximate the opening.



1. A solar module connector comprising:
a cable;
a housing having a mounting surface, a cavity, a cable end, and a passageway between said cavity and said cable end, at least a portion of said mounting surface partially defining an opening for facilitating contact with at least one buss lead of a solar module;
a seal disposed around said cable and at least partially seated in said passageway;
a contact electrically connected to said cable and disposed in said cavity proximate said opening;
a cover mounted to said housing over at least a portion of said cavity and cooperating with said housing to define said opening; and
wherein said cover comprises a post, said contact comprises a first aperture configured for receiving said post, and said housing comprises a second aperture for receiving said post, said post extending through said first aperture and into said second aperture such that said contact is held within said housing.



2. A solar module connector comprising:
a cable;
a housing having a mounting surface, a cavity, a cable end, and a passageway between said cavity and said cable end, at least a portion of said mounting surface partially defines an opening for facilitating contact with at least one buss lead of a solar module;
a seal disposed around said cable and at least partially seated in said passageway;
a contact electrically connected to said cable and disposed in said cavity proximate said opening;
a cover mounted to said housing over at least a portion of said cavity and cooperating with said housing to define said opening; and
wherein said cover and said housing cooperate to define a reservoir proximate said opening and containing a free end of said contact, wherein said reservoir contains a potting material.



3. A solar module connector comprising:
a cable;
a housing having a mounting surface, a cavity, a cable end, and a passageway between said cavity and said cable end, at least a portion of said mounting surface partially defining an opening for facilitating contact with at least one buss lead of a solar module;
a seal disposed around said cable and at least partially seated in said passageway;
a contact electrically connected to said cable and disposed in said cavity proximate said opening;
a cover mounted to said housing over at least a portion of said cavity and cooperating with said housing to define said opening; and
wherein said housing defines a groove on said mounting surface and wherein said cover is interior to said groove.



4. A solar module connector comprising:
a cable;
a housing having a mounting surface, a cavity, a cable end, and a passageway between said cavity and said cable end, at least a portion of said mounting surface partially defining an opening for facilitating contact with at least one buss lead of a solar module; said housing defining a groove on said mounting surface and wherein said opening is interior to said groove;
a seal disposed around said cable and at least partially seated in said passageway; and
a contact electrically connected to said cable and disposed in said cavity proximate said opening.



5. The solar module connector according to claim 4, further comprising a fastener for securing said seal to said cable to prevent axial movement of said seal thereon.


6. The solar module connector according to claim 5, wherein said fastener comprises at least one tab bent outwardly to contact said housing and prevent axial movement of said cable in at least one direction in said passageway.


7. The solar module connector according to claim 4, further comprising:
a cable support bracket disposed on said cable end of said housing and abutting said seal.



8. The solar module connector according to claim 7, wherein said cable support bracket comprises an annulus against which said seal abuts.


9. The solar module connector according to claim 4, further comprising said solar module to which said mounting surface of said housing is mounted, said solar module having said at least one buss lead to which said contact is electrically connected.


10. A connector kit comprising:
a housing having a mounting surface, a cavity, a cable end, and a passageway between said cavity and said cable end, at least a portion of said mounting surface defining an opening for facilitating contact with at least one buss lead of a solar module;
a cover configured for mounting to said housing over at least a portion of said cavity and cooperating with said housing to define said opening;
a seal configured for disposition around a cable and configured for seating in said passageway;
a contact configured for electrically connecting to said cable and configured for disposition in said cavity proximate said opening; and
a cable support bracket configured for disposition on said cable end of said housing, said cable support bracket having an annulus configured for protruding into said passageway and for abutting said seal.
