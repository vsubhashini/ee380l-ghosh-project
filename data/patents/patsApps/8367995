The system and method for automatic positioning of a solar array utilizes modular neural processors pre-trained from existing solar data to estimate the direction of the sun at any location and at any time, irrespective of the orientation or movement of the base unit, and to determine solar panel servo tracking system steering commands for optimal orientation of the solar panel surfaces towards the sun. The automatic positioning system may be used in power generation or water desalination facilities. The device integrates a GPS system, an electronic compass, and an inclination sensor for determination of the orientation of the base unit. Periodic control commands are issued to conventional servo systems for automatic steering of a solar array for maximum solar power acquisition to optimize energy gain versus energy consumption in steering.
