A photovoltaic power generation system comprises: a rectangular- or square-shaped solar cell module M including one or more solar cell elements 5; first and second racks 101, 102 assembled to opposite sides of the solar cell module M, respectively; and a weight member 104 disposed at a predetermined place of the first rack 101 and/or the second rack 102. The system is adapted to be held to place by means of the weight member 104 in order that the solar cell module M may not be blown away by the wind. Therefore, the system may be used simply by placing the system on an installation surface such as a flat roof. This results in the reduction of the number of assembly steps involved in installation works and the reduction of fabrication costs and time. Thus is achieved cost reduction.
