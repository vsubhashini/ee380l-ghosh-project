A “J” Bolt Roof Hardware Mounting stanchion for elevating and supporting objects such as wind turbines and solar panels upon a roof where high load and wind sheer are present. This invention presents a new method of capturing the roof rafter with a bolt shaped in the form of a “J” rather than running the risk of damaging a rafter with a lag bolt. A hole is drilled along side of the roof rafter and the “J” bolt is slipped through the hole and hooked around the bottom of the rafter. The Roof Plate is slid down the shaft of the “J” bolt to the roof deck and then the nut on the shaft of the “J” bolt is tightened to secure the “J” bolt and base plate in place. The stanchions and vibration dampener are installed and the system is ready for use.



1. A “j” bolt roof hardware mounting system for: mounting roof hardware and hardware systems generally related to solar and wind energy systems where high load and wind sheer are present, comprising:
1.1 A steel formed part with custom threading “j” bolt, for capturing the roof rafter;
1.2 a machined steel roof plate, for adding resistance or compression to secure the “j” bolt to the rafter, rigidly connected to said “J” Bolt;
1.3 a drilled and counter bored hole placement holes, for securing the roof plate in place to ease in the operation of tightening the bolt to that secures the “j” bolt in place, rigidly connected to said Roof Plate;
1.4 a none rusting wood screw base plate mounting screws, for holding the bass plate in place until the bolt is tightened, rigidly connected to said placement holes;
1.5 a steel lock washer, for aide in securing the roof plate in place, rigidly connected to said Roof Plate;
1.6 a steel nut, for securing the roof plate and “j” bolt to the rafter by creating an adequate amount of pressure to hold them in place, rigidly connected to said washer;
1.7 a machined steel part bottom stanchion, for raising the stanchion to a level above the roof flashing, rigidly connected to said nut;
1.8 a galvanized roof flashing with rubber boot standard 2″ roof flashing, for roof flashing to prevent moisture penetration into the mounting system, firmly connected to said bottom stanchion;
1.9 a milled out cavity, for making sure that the bottom stanchion sits flat on the base plate, structurally connected to said bottom stanchion;
1.10 a high density machined rubber vibration dampener (1), for preventing vibration and low frequency noise from reaching the rafter, rigidly connected to said bottom stanchion;
1.11 a second high density machined rubber vibration dampener (2), for preventing vibration and low frequency noise from reaching the rafter, rigidly connected to said vibration dampener (1);
1.12 a machined steel part top stanchion, for raising the stanchion to its maximum height off the roof, rigidly connected to said vibration dampener (2);
1.13 a steel lock washer, washer (2), for aide in securing the mounting bracket for either the wind turbine mounts, solar panel mounting rack or any other apparatus that requires a high load mounting system, rigidly connected to said top stanchion; and
1.14 a steel machined nut, nut (2), for securing the mounting bracket for either the wind turbine mounts, solar panel mounting rack or any other apparatus that requires a high load mounting system, rigidly connected to said washer (2).
