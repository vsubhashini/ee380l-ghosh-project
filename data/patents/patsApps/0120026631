In an embodiment, inverter circuitry has switching devices that generate three-phase AC voltage that is supplied to a utility power grid interface transformer. A high impedance circuit as well as a ground fault monitoring circuit couple to the inverter circuit. The high impedance circuit is configured to periodically create a path to Earth ground, and thus, completes the Earth ground electrical path back to the ground fault detection circuit. A set of isolation contacts at the AC 3-phase power output connect as well as isolate this particular inverter from the utility grid interface transformer. Control components in the ground fault monitoring circuit control the operation of the isolation contacts based off a presence of a ground fault in ungrounded solar arrays that supply DC power to this ungrounded inverter circuitry when the ground fault is detected by the ground fault monitor circuit for that ungrounded inverter.
