A photovoltaic power conditioning system and method is provided. The system includes an isolated DC/DC converter (41), a DC/AC inverter (42), and a sine filter (43). The isolated DC/DC converter (41) receives a DC voltage from a solar cell through a parallel connection structure and converts the DC voltage into another DC voltage and then outputs the converted DC voltage through a series connection structure.
