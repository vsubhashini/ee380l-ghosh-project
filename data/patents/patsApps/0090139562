A portable, lightweight and detachable photovoltaic window system affording a resource for converting solar power in existing buildings and similar structures. At least one photovoltaic panel is interconnected to a building window or entrance casing or directly to a window pane through use of lanyards, hook and loop fasteners, or suction cups. Solar energy is captured from direct sunlight incidental to the location of the window. A panel may be removably supported by a fabric material interconnected to an interior wall via hook and loop fasteners. An inverter converts energy from DC to AC for powering electrically driven devices. A pocket is provided on the panel support for temporarily storing the auxiliary devices. This system enables a person with little knowledge of solar energy equipment a convenient and inexpensive method to convert sunlight into useful energy without major alterations to the building or window unit being used as a light-source.

9. The portable photovoltaic device of claim 1 further defined by:
at least some of said fasteners each comprising a lanyard element with a hook member affixed to at least one end thereof and configured to directly engage at least one of said outer framing edges.



10. The portable photovoltaic device of claim 1 further defined by:
said panel mounting support is provided with at least one eyelet anchor element;
at least some of said fasteners comprising a lanyard element with a loop member affixed to at least one end thereof and configured to directly engage at least one of said eyelet anchor elements on said panel mounting support.



11. The portable photovoltaic device of claim 1 further distinguished by:
said photovoltaic panel mounting support includes a first side facing outwardly in a first direction toward said glass pane and said photovoltaic panel, and a second side facing inwardly in a direction opposite said first direction and toward said point of application;
said second side of said photovoltaic panel mounting support further including a storage pouch configured to temporarily store said inverter and electric wiring system when not in use.



12. A portable photovoltaic device including at least one photovoltaic panel interconnected to an associated electric wiring system and inverter, wherein said panel device is configured for placement within at least one opening in a building wall structure, and wherein said opening is recessed within a defined wall opening having a generally surrounding framing area and outer framing edges, and said at least one opening having exposure to solar incidence, said photovoltaic panel device further including:
a photovoltaic panel mounting support including fasteners for securely engaging said photovoltaic panel to said mounting support for releasably holding said photovoltaic panel in position within said at least one opening so as to gain advantageous solar incidence therewith;
said fasteners configured for manual engagement and disengagement so as to install, remove and replace said portable photovoltaic panel within said framing area without surface damage or alteration to said panel, wall or defined wall opening;
said mounting support member further configured to enable uninterrupted passage of said associated wiring to said inverter;

whereby solar energy may be collected by said panel device and fed as electricity to a point of application where it is used by at least one electrically operated device and said portable panel device may be readily removed for storage or for non-damaging placement in another defined wall opening with advantageous solar incidence.


13. The portable photovoltaic panel device of claim 12, further distinguished by:
said photovoltaic panel mounting support comprising a fabric material to which said panel is removably affixed;
