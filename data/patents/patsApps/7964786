A solar battery module capable of assuring the fluid-tight structure of the roof panels adjacent to each other in lateral direction, realizing a weathering between the modules, eliminating a process for providing a seal member between the ends of the modules adjacent to each other, and facilitating an assembly operation, wherein a recessed part extending from the ridge side to the eaves side of the solar battery module is formed at lateral one end thereof, a projected part in the shape of coming into the recessed part is formed at the other end, and a waterproof means for suppressing the rain water invaded onto the upper surface of the projected part from circulating to the lower surface thereof is installed on the projected part in the state of being inserted into the corresponding recessed part of the solar battery module disposed adjacently to the side.



1. A method of installing a plurality of solar battery modules on a main roof structure having a ridge and eaves, the method comprising:
a step of providing a plurality of solar battery modules on the main roof structure, wherein each solar battery module has an eaves-side end nearest the eaves, a ridge-side end nearest the ridge, a left side, and a right side; each solar battery module comprises a solar battery and a supporting stand provided on a back face of the solar battery along the eaves-side end of the solar battery module and whereby the solar battery is fixed to the main roof structure; and the solar battery modules of the plurality of solar battery modules are disposed in mutually adjacent fashion on the main roof structure in which:
each said supporting stand includes a mounting groove that receives the ridge-side end of a solar battery module of said plurality of solar battery modules that is adjacently disposed on the eaves side, each solar battery of said plurality of solar battery modules comprises a recessed part that extends along one of the left or the right sides from the eaves-side end to the ridge-side end,
each solar battery of said plurality of solar battery modules comprises a projecting part that extends along the other of the left or the right sides and has a shape that will enter a corresponding said recessed part of an adjacent solar battery, and
a waterproofing means is provided such that when said projecting part is inserted into a corresponding recessed part of an adjacent solar battery, said waterproofing means prevents rainwater that has reached an upper surface of said projecting part from reaching a lower surface of said projecting part;
a step of providing a water flow checking means that covers a gap between and links adjacent supporting stands of adjacent solar batteries of said plurality of solar battery modules disposed on the left side and right side of each other and prevents invasion of rainwater;
a step of providing gaskets in the mounting grooves of said adjacent supporting stands such that joint portions between ends of adjacent gaskets are positioned corresponding to said upper surface of said projecting part of a solar battery that is inserted into said corresponding said recessed part;
a step of inserting the ridge-side end of a solar battery of a solar battery module of said plurality of solar battery modules in said gaskets; and
a step of inserting said projecting part of a solar battery module of said plurality of solar battery modules into said corresponding said recessed part of an adjacent solar battery.



2. The method of installing a plurality of solar battery modules according to claim 1, further comprising a step of arranging sealing members for sealing said joint portions at locations where the joint portions are positioned in said mounting grooves, wherein a separation between facing edges of adjacent sealing members is less than a length dimension of said gaskets; and
a step of mounting said sealing members by compressing said sealing members at ends thereof along the length direction of the gaskets by bending deformation of said gaskets in the step of providing gaskets in the mounting grooves.



3. The method of installing a plurality of solar battery modules according to claim 1, wherein each said water flow checking means is constituted by a water flow checking metal element which is a metal structural element having durability and said adjacent supporting stands are mutually electrically connected through said water flow checking metal elements.


4. The method of installing a plurality of solar battery modules according to claim 3, wherein said water flow check metal element is provided with:
(a) a slot whereby temporary securing of a first end of said metal element is effected slidably along a longitudinal direction with respect to said adjacent supporting stands in a first screw securing portion, and
(b) a second end of said metal element comprising a second screw securing portion that includes an open hole that is C-shaped and that receives the shank of a loosened mounting screw provided in one of said adjacent supporting stands,
wherein temporary securing is effected by the second screw securing portion and the first screw securing portion is fixed by sliding said metal element after the second screw securing portion has been fixed by tightening said mounting screw.
