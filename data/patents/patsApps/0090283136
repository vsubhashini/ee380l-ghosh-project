The invention relates to a panel form photovoltaic frameless solar module, in particular, a large surface solar module having increased stability and strength. The aim of the invention is to produce the panel form photovoltaic solar module which is insensitive to rough climatic effects of the weather as well as effective at diffusing very high mechanical stresses in the substructure. A planar light weight reinforcement structure (5) is at least partially stuck directly to the reverse side of the material (4), for planar or curved solar modules, in the inventive panel form photovoltaic frameless solar module (1) which comprise solar cells (3), which are embedded between cover side of the material (2) and the reverse side of the material (4). Said light weight reinforcement structure (5) is embodied entirely or partially on at least two sides as a supporting frame structure (6), that is additionally reinforced. The invention can be used for commercial, panel form solar modules, in particular, for thin-walled solar module embodiments, like those produced, in particular, in glass-film-laminates.
