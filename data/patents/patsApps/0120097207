Provided are photovoltaic module assemblies configured for improved installation. The assemblies include frameless photovoltaic modules and retainers for supporting the modules on mounting structures. The retainers support the modules at least during cure of adhesive materials provided between the modules and the mounting structures. Once cured, the adhesive materials provide permanent support to the modules. The retainers may interlock with the mounting structures during installation or be integral components of the structures. In certain embodiments, retainers are used to control a gap between the modules and mounting structures. Retainers may be removable and collected after installation is completed. Alternatively, retainers may remain as parts of assemblies at least during some initial period. Retainers may be made from various degradable materials, such as biodegradable plastics, UV degradable plastics, and/or water soluble materials. Provided also are methods for installing frameless photovoltaic modules on mounting structures.
