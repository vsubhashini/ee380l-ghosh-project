a surface; 
a frame; 
a panel sensitive to the actinic radiation; 
means to mount said frame on said surface; 
means to mount said panel to said frame, said frame exposed to the actinic radiation; and 
means to transfer energy from said panel through a chaseway on said frame thence to a power network. 

 

2- The system of claim 1 wherein said panel includes an architectural pigmentation emissive to the actinic radiation. 
 

3- The system of claim 2 further comprising: 
means to interconnect a plurality of said frames on said surface, each of said frames having a panel mounted therein; and 
means to combine energy from all said panels for output to said power network. 

 

4- A method for converting actinic radiation to another form of energy, the steps including: 
forming a panel by connecting a plurality of photovoltaic cells, said panel of photovoltaic cells having a plurality of electrical tabs exiting said panel, each said electrical tab attached to a separate connection wire, each of said connection wires travelling from said panel perpendicular to an edge of said panel and further travelling through a clip that directs said connection wires to separate locations; 
lodging said panel in a frame, said frame comprising a recess to receive said panel, separate paths for each said connection wire, a hood adjacent said recess to receive said clip, and means to receive and direct said connection wires along an edge of said frame, said panel and frame comprising a tile; 
electrically interconnecting a plurality of said tiles; 
imbricating a plurality of said interconnected tiles on a surface exposed to actinic radiation; 
combining output from said interconnected tiles; and 
feeding said combined output into a power network. 

 

5- An apparatus for converting actinic radiation to another form of energy, comprising, in combination: 
a plurality of photovoltaic cells, said photovoltaic cells electrically interconnected with one another and oriented into a panel, wherein output from said panel is directed through a plurality of electrical tabs, said electrical tabs attached to a plurality of connection wires to direct output from said panel, said connection wires routed through a clip; and 
a frame, said frame comprising, in combination: 
a recess to receive said panel such that a surface of said panel not contacting said frame is planar with respect to a non-recessed portion of said frame, said recess formed by a plurality of cross pieces, said cross pieces defining windows in said frame; 
a mounting portion on an edge of said non-recessed portion of said frame, said mounting portion having means to mount a combined frame and panel to a surface; 
a plurality of separate paths, each path to receive one said connection wire from said panel; and 
a hood to receive said clip from said panel. 


 

6- The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said frame further comprises complemental end portions on two opposing edges of said frame that are not said mounting portion, wherein said complemental end portions engage one another such that a plurality of frames may be placed adjacent one another in a particular orientation. 
 

7- The apparatus of claim 6 further comprising a glass outer sheet adjacent said panel opposite said frame. 
 

8- The apparatus of claim 7 further comprising two layers of ethyl-vinyl acetate adjacent to and on either side of said panel. 
 

9- The apparatus of claim 8 further comprising an aluminum heat sink adjacent to and between said ethyl-vinyl acetate layer and said frame. 
 

10- The apparatus of claim 9 further comprising wind loading clips, said wind loading clips mounted to said means to mount said combined frame and panel to a surface of one said frame and said wind loading clips dimensioned to receive a portion of another said frame. 
 

11- An apparatus for converting actinic radiation to another form of energy, comprising, in combination: 
a plurality of photovoltaic cells oriented in a panel, said panel having means to output current through connection wires; 
a frame, said frame comprising, in combination: 
a recess to receive said panel; 
mounting means to mount said frame on a surface, said mounting means on a separate portion of said frame than said recess; 
means to separate and direct said connection wires away from said panel; and 

clip means to selectively attach one said frame to another said frame.
