It is an object to develop a roof structure having high water interception, being safe from rain leakage, and ensuring a certain level of mounting strength even in the case of a broken roof member. Solar cell modules are mounted on a roof structure with slate tiles via eaves-side mounting brackets and intermediate mounting brackets. The intermediate mounting brackets are attached to a “specific roof member” wherein a lower plate is positioned between the “specific roof member” and an “underlying roof member.” The lower plate is fixed by a screw driven into a hole. The “specific roof member” is arranged over the “underlying roof member”, thereby protecting an attaching hole from rainwater. An upper plate overlaps the “specific roof member” with a fastening element driven into the attaching hole. An “overlying roof member” is arranged over the “specific roof member,” thereby protecting the attaching hole from rainwater.
