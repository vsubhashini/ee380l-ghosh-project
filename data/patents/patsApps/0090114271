Methods and devices are provided for rapid solar module installation. In one embodiment, a photovoltaic module is provided comprising of a plurality of photovoltaic cells a plurality of photovoltaic modules; at least a first type of mounting bracket in contact with the module; at least a second type of mounting bracket, wherein the brackets are configured to interlock and connect multiple modules together.



1. A photovoltaic module mounting system comprising:
a plurality of photovoltaic modules;
at least a first type of mounting bracket in contact with the module;
at least a second type of mounting bracket, wherein the brackets are configured to interlock and connect multiple modules together.



2. The module of claim 1 wherein the module is a frameless module.


3. The module of claim 1 wherein the interlock involves interlocking around a mounting structure which provides load carrying capacity for the module.


4. The module of claim 1 wherein the interlock involves bringing brackets together to circumferentially surround one portion of a support rail.


5. The module of claim 1 wherein first type of mounting bracket has a male design to engage the second type of mounting bracket which has a female design.


6. The module of claim 1 wherein the first type of mounting bracket has an opening in the bracket that can be oriented to receive a mounting rail, and wherein the first type mounting bracket also has a portion that can mate with the second type of mounting bracket when pivoted into position after the mounting rail has been engaged.


7. The module of claim 1 wherein the first type of mounting bracket can only be disengaged from the second type of mounting bracket by a pivoting motion of one bracket relative to another.


8. The module of claim 1 wherein the bracket is configured to slidably engage a mounting structure.
