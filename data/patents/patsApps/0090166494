4. The mounting system according to claim 1, wherein the connectors (5) for the roof fastening are constructed as spaced apart continuous longitudinal groove pair (5.1, 5.2), as longitudinal flange pair or as crimped longitudinal flange pair (17.1-17.2) in or on the support profile (3) into which or over which the roof fastening means grip with a positive fit, which are constructed in the same manner as the clamping parts for the fastening of the solar modules.


5. The mounting system according to claim 1, wherein the longitudinal flange pair (17.1-17.2) is formed by a groove with outwardly narrowed groove width.


6. The mounting system according to claim 1, wherein longitudinal grooves or longitudinal flanges are provided respectively for the clicking on or clicking in of clamping parts of the roof fastening and the solar module fastening.


7. The mounting system according to claim 1, wherein the support profile (3) is a rectangular or square box profile and the longitudinal grooves of the longitudinal groove pairs (4.1-4.2) or (5.1-5.2) or the longitudinal flanges are respectively found on or in a profile surface and at the two lateral edges or respectively on or in opposingly positioned profile surfaces respectively at the lateral edges or respectively on or in adjacent profile surfaces.


8. The mounting system according to claim 1, wherein the support profile (3) has a hexagonal or octagonal box cross-section constructed in that the edges of a rectangular or square profile are formed as edge surfaces (6.1, 6.2) on top and as far as necessary as edge surfaces below (7.1, 7.2) and longitudinal grooves or longitudinal flanges are provided respectively therein.


9. The mounting system according to claim 8, wherein the length of the edge surfaces (6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2) is shorter than that of the remaining rectangular or square profile lengths.


10. The mounting system according to claim 8, wherein a longitudinal groove (4, 5) is provided in the edge surfaces (6, 7) the profile cross-section is reinforced in the region of the edge surfaces (6, 7).


11. The mounting system according to claim 1, wherein the longitudinal grooves (4, 5) or the longitudinal flange pair (17.1-17.2) formed as a groove is a single or double sided dovetail track.


12. The mounting system according to claim 1, wherein the inwardly crimped longitudinal flange pairs (17.1-17.2) are respectively positioned in or on a profile surface of supports (2) with a rectangular or square support profile (3).


13. The mounting system according to claim 1, wherein the shaped part (8) on each side has two spaced apart webs (9) or on one side one web (9) and on the other side two webs (9).


14. The mounting system according to claim 1, wherein the inner spacing of the webs (9.1, 9.2) and the open gap width of the crimped longitudinal flange pair (17.1, 17.2) or the outer free width are dimensioned such that the installed fastening bolt (14) prevents a loosening of the clicked in webs (9.1, 9.2) from the at least positive connection by pushing together of the webs (9.1, 9.2).
