The device disclosed herein is a double jointed mounting for a solar panel which enables the solar panel to move so that its orientation with the sun is optimal for the collection of sunlight for the subsequent conversion to electrical energy. The double jointed mounting consists of a mount housing which contains two ball and socket joints located at either end of the mount housing. The solar panel can rotate independently about either ball and socket joint to maintain the optimal position for the collection of solar energy. 



1. A mounting system for a solar panel comprising: 
a first ball positioned on an object to be powered by energy originating as solar energy; 
a second ball positioned on a solar panel assembly; 
a mounting bar having two sections connected by a threaded fastener, said mounting bar having a first socket and a second socket on each end constructed and arranged to surround said first ball and said second ball respectively; 
whereby said solar panel assembly may be positioned to receive direct sunlight for a substantial portion of each day. 

 

2. The mounting system for a solar panel defined in claim 1 wherein said object to be powered is a lamp. 
 

3. A device for adjusting the orientation of a substantially planar object comprising: 
a first ball positioned on the base supporting said substantially planar object; 
a second ball positioned on said substantially planar object; 
a mounting bar having two sections connected by a threaded fastener, said mounting bar having a first socket and a second socket on each and constructed and arranged to surround said first ball and said second ball respectively; 
whereby said substantially planar object may be positioned in any orientation relative to said base.
