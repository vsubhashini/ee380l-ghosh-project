An indoor photovoltaic energy system to provide a renewable energy source for buildings located in urban areas or other locations where there is insufficient land or roof area for mounting a sufficient number of photovoltaic panels to general a significant amount of electric energy. This concept is especially beneficial for multi-story buildings with a low ratio of roof space or available ground space per square foot of building space. This system uses standard indoor electric lighting fixtures as well as any available natural light through windows, skylights or other building openings for the light source that is converted to electric power. The direct current electric power generated by the photovoltaic panels is converted to more usable alternating current electric power by an inverter. 



1. Photovoltaic panels mounted inside a building wherein said photovoltaic panels are exposed to artificial and/or natural light thus enabling said photovoltaic panels to generate direct current electric power that is in-turn transmitted through connected wires to an inverter or inverters that convert the direct current electric power into alternating current electric power, the improvement wherein renewable electric power is generated inside a building where there is insufficient ground or roof space to provide a conventional outdoor photovoltaic energy system. 
 

2. The mounting of said photovoltaic panels may be atop furniture or equipment within the building, mounted on the walls of the building or placed on the floor of the building. 
 

3. Numerous said photovoltaic panels may be connected by wire to transmit direct current electric power to one or more said inverters. 
 

4. Said photovoltaic panels may be mounted in one or more rooms on one or more stories in a multi-story building to maximize the generation of electric energy by said photovoltaic panels.
