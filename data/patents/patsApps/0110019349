A junction box for mounting on solar modules is disclosed. The junction box enables fully automatic mounting on the solar module, and also automated assembly of the components in the box. The box has a housing with cover. The housing encloses electrical components, such as bypass diodes, and includes connectors that connect to ribbon conductors from the solar module. Within the housing is a positioning block with slots for receiving the ribbon conductors. A hold-down device is also provided in the housing and, when the junction box is mounted on the solar module, the hold-down device presses the ribbon conductors into the slots.



1. A junction box with a housing (5), in which bypass diodes (12) and necessary electrical connectors are assembled, wherein the electrical connectors have connector ends (7) that serve to connect the ribbon conductors (3) to the solar module (4), characterized in that the connector ends (7) are connected with contact clamps (8) which have two legs (9) and embrace the ribbon conductors (3) when the box is mounted, and the junction box encompasses a positioning block (1) in which receiving slots (2) for the ribbon conductors (3) of the solar module (4) are formed, the form of the receiving slots (2) corresponding to the form of the ribbon conductors (3), each slot (2) being provided with two recesses (11), and a hold-down device (10) being mounted on the housing (5) or housing cover to press the ribbon conductors (3), the connector ends (7) and the clamps (8) into the slots (2) of the positioning block (1), the two legs (9) of the clamps (8) each being received by one of the two recesses (11).
