A means for effectively preventing the temperature rise of the diode when the bypass diode is operating in a terminal box for a crystalline silicon solar cell panel is provided. The present invention is characterized in that, in the terminal box for a crystalline silicon solar cell panel, Schottky barrier diode is used as a bypass diode. Preferably, the forward-direction voltage drop of the Schottky barrier diode is the specific value or below at the specific junction temperature. Preferably, as a Schottky barrier diode, a package diode which is surface-mounting type or non-insulation type is used.



1. A terminal box for a crystalline silicon solar cell panel, wherein the terminal box comprises a bypass diode, and wherein the bypass diode is a Schottky barrier diode that has a junction temperature guarantee value of 150° C. or above, and the forward-direction voltage drop of the Schottky barrier diode when an electric current of 10 A is passed is 0.50 V or below at a junction temperature of 25° C., 0.40 V or below at a junction temperature of 100° C., and 0.35 V or below at a junction temperature of 150° C.


2. The terminal box for a solar cell panel according to claim 1, wherein the forward-direction voltage drop of the Schottky barrier diode when an electric current of 10 A is passed is 0.45 V or below at a junction temperature of 25° C., 0.35 V or below at a junction temperature of 100° C., and 0.30V or below at a junction temperature of 150° C.


3. The terminal box for a solar cell panel according to any of claim 1 or 2, wherein the terminal box is further equipped with a heat-dissipating plate for allowing the heat generated by the bypass diode to escape and/or an enlarged terminal plate for allowing the heat generated by the bypass diode to escape.


4. The terminal box for a solar cell panel according to claim 3, wherein the Schottky barrier diode is a surface-mounting type or non-insulation type package diode.
