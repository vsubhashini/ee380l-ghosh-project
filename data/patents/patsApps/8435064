The invention relates to a mounting (6) for a dc-ac converter (3) in a photovoltaic system (1), the mounting being designed to detachably accommodate the converter (3). The converter (3) can be connected to at least one solar module (2) and an alternating current supply (4) via at least one connection cable (5). The invention also relates to a method for fitting a dc-ac converter (3) to a mounting (6) of this type. To allow the simple and rapid fitting of the dc-ac converter (3), a first part (8) of a connector (7) for connecting the connection cable (5) of the dc-ac converter (3) and also a device (9) for guiding the converter are provided on the mounting (6), the guide device (9) being designed to automatically bring the first part (8) of the connector (7) into contact with a second part (10) of the connector (7) that is located on the dc-ac converter (3).



1. A mounting (6) for an inverter (3) of a photovoltaic system (1), which is designed to detachably accommodate the inverter (3), wherein the inverter (3) can be connected to at least one solar module (2) and an alternating current supply (4) via at least one connection cable (5) for each, and a first part (8) of a plug connector (7) for connecting the connection cables (5) of the inverter (3) and, furthermore, devices (9) for guiding the inverter (3) are provided, which guiding devices (9) are designed to automatically contact the first part (8) of the plug connector (7) with a second part (10) of the plug connector (7) that is arranged on the inverter (3), wherein the mounting (6) is formed by a rear wall (11) and two side walls (12) and the guiding devices (9) are integrated into the side walls (12) of the mounting (6), wherein the guiding devices (9) are formed by a first horizontal guiding groove (13) and a second vertical guiding groove (14) for guiding the inverter (3) in at least two steps, so that during the guiding down along the vertical guiding groove (14) the automatic contacting between the first part (8) and the second part (10) of the plug connector (7) is effected,
wherein the guiding devices (9) are designed in such a way that after the first step, the first part (8) of the plug connector (7) is positioned for automatic contacting with respect to the second part (10) of the plug connector (7), and
wherein the guiding devices (9) are designed in such a way that after the at least second step, the inverter (3) is secured within the guiding devices (9).



2. A method for fitting an inverter (3) of a photovoltaic system (1), wherein a housing (16) of the inverter (3) is hooked to a mounting (6), which mounting (6) is formed by a rear wall (11) and two side walls (12), and guiding devices (9) are integrated into the side walls (12) of the mounting (6), wherein the guiding devices (9) are formed by a first horizontal guiding groove (13) and a second vertical guiding groove (14) for guiding the inverter (3) in at least two steps, and the inverter (3) is connected to at least one solar module (2) and an alternating current supply (4) via at least one connection cable (5) for each, wherein the connection cables (5) are first connected to a part (8) of a plug connector (7) that is connected to the mounting (6), and then the inverter (3), which is provided with a second part (10) of the plug connector (7), is automatically contacted with the first part (8) of the plug connector (7) by being hooked to the mounting (6) during the guiding down along the vertical guiding groove (14),
wherein after being hooked to the mounting (6), the inverter (3) is secured in a position in which the parts (8, 10) of the plug connector (7) are contacted.



3. The fitting method according to claim 2, wherein the inverter (3) is secured within the mounting (6) by means of guiding bolts (15) in corresponding guiding grooves (14).


4. The fitting method according to claim 2, wherein a cap for shielding the inverter (3) is connected to the mounting (6).


5. The fitting method according to claim 2, wherein during connection of the parts (8, 10) of the plug connector (7) an over-voltage protection circuit of the inverter (3) is activated.
