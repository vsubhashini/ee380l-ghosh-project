The suspended, hot box solar collector is designed to provide approximately double area solar insolation on to a closed, truncated triangular structure which is double-glazed and insulated to collect and store solar heat energy for hot air space heating. Direct solar radiation is collected through sloped front, bottom and top double-glazed windows, with reflected solar rays received through the same windows by means of fixed, highly reflective surfaces of about the same corresponding total surface area. Solar radiation collection in three planes, both direct and reflected will produce very high temperatures with the storage of a portion of this heat energy within thermal storage compartments within the unit. The suspended, hot box unit is designed for both winter time space heating and summer-time photovoltaic/electric power generation, for both back yard and flat roof top installations.
