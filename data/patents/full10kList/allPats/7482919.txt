An emergency egress system includes a controller that is located within a dwelling, adjacent to a window thereof, and has a user interface. The controller is coupled to an external power supply source, including solar and alternating current power supply sources. Light emitting objects are vertically and horizontally seated about a window perimeter, facing towards the dwelling's interior. A dedicated communications link transmits a distress signal to a monitoring system and is coupled to an alarm, including a smoke-, a fire-, a carbon monoxide- and a security system-alarm. A ladder assembly is positioned adjacent to the window. A mechanism is included for automatically opening the window and the ladder assembly, allowing the occupant to exit the dwelling through the window via the ladder assembly. The automatic window biasing mechanism and the light emitting objects are responsive to a distress signal emitted from the at least one alarm.
