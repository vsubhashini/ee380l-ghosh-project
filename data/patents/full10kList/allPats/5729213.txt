A compact railroad/highway crossing motorist warning device comprising; a rail track mounted pressure sensor switch assembly which timely activates and deactivates a radio frequency transmitter beacon located upon the crossbuck at the rail crossing, the beacon transmits recordable audio and video signals and: a series of mobile sympathetic radio signal receiver units, for highway motor in vehicle and in locomotive application, the in motor vehicle receiver is hardwired to the motor vehicle and the in locomotive receiver has an event recording means attached.
Claims I hereby claim: 1. A system for warning highway vehicles, locomotive operators and motorists of the approach of a locomotive and train into a nearby rail/highway crossing, comprising; a duality of rail trackage mounted pressure sensor electrical switch arrays, said pressure sensor switch array is mounted to the rail trackage, one sensor switch is mounted to the trackage fore and one sensor switch is mounted to the trackage aft of said rail highway crossing, said sensor switch array is connected to an electrical wiring circuit provided at a rail/highway crossing, said sensor switch array completes an electrical circuit when rail traffic enters the rail crossing, and interrupts the electrical circuit when rail traffic exits the crossing; and a miniature, intermittently active, encased and weatherproofed MHZ multiplex radio frequency transmitter "beacon" unit, powered and hardwired in conjunction with said pressure sensor electrical switch and existing railroad crossing electrical circuitry, the transmitter beacon is mounted to the railroad crossing "crossbuck pole", and said transmitter beacon unit is electrically activated and deactivated by rail traffic activity detected by said rail mounted pressure sensor electrical switch array, said transmitter beacon unit communicates with nearby sympathetic in-vehicle and in-locomotive receivers, said transmitter beacon has a microchip video camera attached, active upon transmitter activation, said transmitter beacon simultaneously provides a companion recordable signal to a centralized, dedicated recording station, which station monitors system performance and fulfillment; and an encased, miniature sympathetic MHZ radio frequency microprocessor receiver unit for highway motor vehicle use, said receiver unit is provided with an enlarged faceplate, said faceplate fully comprises a motor vehicle rearview mirror, said faceplate contains a multiplicity of symbolic illuminated visual display icons with a series of accompanying simulated electronic voice audio warning messages therewithin, upon receiver receipt of the coded radio signal emanating from said rail crossing transmitter beacon, the visual iconic and audio warning messages are coordinated and displayed to present a combined alert signal to the motor vehicle operator, said receiver is a retrofit to fully replace a motor vehicle rear view mirror, and is hardwired to the motor vehicle primary electrical system; and an encased, miniature sympathetic MHZ radio frequency microprocessor receiver unit for in-locomotive use, said receiver unit is provided with a faceplate containing a multiplicity of symbolic illuminated visual display icons, and accompanying simulated electronic voice audio warning messages, upon receiver receipt of the coded radio signal emanating from said rail crossing transmitter beacon, the iconic visual and audio warning messages are co-ordinated and displayed at said receiver to present a combined alert signal to the locomotive and train operator, said receiver is a retrofit for mounting within the cabin of the lead locomotive, and is hardwired to the locomotive electrical system, and said locomotive receiver has an accompanying system event recording means provided, with removable data storage. 2. A system for warning highway vehicles and motorists of the approach of a locomotive and train into a nearby rail/highway crossing according to claim 1, wherein said microchip video camera means is deployed in multiplicity to allow for a wide crossing site view area. 3. A system for warning highway vehicles and motorists of the approach of a locomotive and train into a nearby rail/highway crossing according to claim 1, wherein said motor vehicle receiver is united with an in-vehicle AM/FM/GPS radio receiver. 4. A system for warning highway vehicles, locomotive operators and motorists of the approach of a locomotive and train into a nearby rail/highway crossing, comprising; a duality of rail trackage mounted pressure sensor electrical switch arrays, said pressure sensor switch array is mounted to the rail trackage, one sensor switch is mounted to the trackage fore and one sensor switch is mounted to the trackage aft of said rail highway crossing, said sensor switch array is connected to an electrical wiring circuit provided at a rail/highway crossing, said sensor switch array completes an electrical circuit when rail traffic enters the rail crossing, and interrupts the electrical circuit when rail traffic exits the crossing; and a battery/solar photovoltaic powered miniature, intermittently active, railroad crossing "crossbuck pole" mounted, encased and weatherproofed MHZ multiplex radio frequency transmitter "beacon " unit, said transmitter beacon unit is electrically activated and deactivated by rail traffic activity detected by said rail mounted pressure sensor electrical switches, said transmitter beacon unit communicates with nearby in-vehicle and in-locomotive sympathetic receivers, said transmitter beacon has a microchip video camera means attached, active upon transmitter activation, said transmitter beacon simultaneously provides a companion signal to a centralized, dedicated recording station, which station monitors system performance and fulfillment; and an encased, miniature sympathetic MHZ radio frequency microprocessor receiver unit for highway motor vehicle use, said receiver unit is provided with an enlarged faceplate, said faceplate fully comprises a motor vehicle rearview mirror, said faceplate contains a multiplicity of symbolic illuminated visual display icons and a series of accompanying simulated electronic voice audio warning messages therewithin, upon receiver receipt of the coded radio signal emanating from said rail crossing transmitter beacon, the visual iconic and audio warning messages are coordinated and displayed to present a combined alert signal to the motor vehicle operator, said receiver is a retrofit to fully replace a motor vehicle rear view mirror, and is hardwired to the motor vehicle primary electrical system; and an encased, miniature sympathetic MHZ radio frequency microprocessor receiver unit for in-locomotive use, said receiver unit is provided with a faceplate containing a multiplicity of symbolic illuminated visual display icons, and accompanying simulated electronic voice audio warning messages, upon receiver receipt of the coded radio signal emanating from said rail crossing transmitter beacon, the iconic visual and audio warning messages are co-ordinated and displayed at said receiver to present a combined alert signal to the locomotive and train operator, said receiver is a retrofit for mounting within the cabin of the lead locomotive, and is hardwired to the locomotive electrical system, and said locomotive receiver has an accompanying system event recording means provided, with removable data storage.
