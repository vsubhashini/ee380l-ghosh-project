A solar-rechargeable light fixture. A preferred embodiment is adapted for attachment to the horizontal cross-bar of a yard-mounted real estate sign effective to illuminate both sides of the sign after dark. The light fixture includes a solar panel adapted to charge a battery which powers a plurality of lights, such as incandescent bulbs or LEDs. Sometimes, a microprocessor is included in-circuit to control operation of the light fixture, and may also provide diagnostic feedback to a user. Desirably, the light fixture can be switched into a storage mode to avoid discharge of the battery during periods of non-use.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus, comprising: a solar-rechargeable light fixture operable to illuminate both sides of a sign depending below, and in a plane parallel to a plane passing through a length axis of, a substantially horizontal cross-bar of a residential, yard-mounted, real estate sign holder, said cross-bar comprising a width, transverse to said length axis, wherein: said light fixture comprises: a prismatic housing defined by walls arranged to define a substantially enclosed volume between a top and a bottom, said bottom being configured for anchoring on top of said cross-bar, and arranged to dispose substantially the entire enclosed volume above said top of said cross-bar; a first LED carried by said housing to project in a first direction, parallel to said width, by a distance sufficient to overhang beyond an edge of said cross-bar effective to cast illumination in a straight line past said cross-bar and onto one side of said sign, said first LED being encircled by a first reflective wall configured to urge illumination from said first LED in a direction toward said sign; a second LED carried by said housing to project in a second direction, parallel to said width, by a distance sufficient to overhang beyond an edge of said cross-bar effective to cast illumination in a straight line past said cross-bar and onto the other side of said sign, said second LED being encircled by a second reflective wall configured to urge illumination from said second LED in a direction toward said sign; a mounting member comprising a foot transversely projecting from a central portion of a wall of said housing, said foot encompassing a through-hole structured to permit fastening said housing to said cross-bar; a charging device adapted to convert radiation to electrical energy, said charging device being carried by said housing operably to expose said charging device to radiation from the sun; a rechargeable energy storage device disposed in said housing and in-circuit to permit electrical communication between said energy storage device and said charging device to urge said energy storage device toward an electrically charged condition, and to permit electrical communication between said energy storage device and said first LED and said second LED; a microprocessor disposed in-circuit to control illumination output of said light fixture; a magnetic pick-up device associated with said microprocessor effective to provide a control input to said microprocessor; and an override switch comprising a normally open contact that is maintained in a closed position by structure anchoring said housing on said cross-bar.
