An outer glass pipe for a solar heat collector pipe includes an outer glass pipe body formed of a straight glass pipe being open at both ends and a lid member provided therein with a small diameter opening. An exhaust pipe of a small diameter is attached to the lid member to form a bottom member. The bottom member is air-tightly fixed to one open end of the outer glass pipe body on its peripheral edge to close one of the open ends.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An outer glass pipe for a solar heat collector pipe comprising: an outer glass pipe body formed of a straight glass pipe being open at both ends; and a bottom member closing one open end of said outer glass pipe body, said bottom member including a flat disc-like bottom sealing glass lid member hermetically welded to said one open end of said outer glass pipe body on its peripheral edge, said lid member having a central small exhaust opening provided therethrough, and a small diameter exhaust glass pipe hermetically welded at one end to said glass lid member at said exhaust opening so as to communicate with the exhaust opening and extending concentrically with an axially outwardly from the lid member, said lid member having an annular groove in its outer surface around said exhaust opening and around said one end of the exhaust glass pipe to thereby enable the exhaust pipe to be chipped off at a location closer to the outer surface of said lid member, and a plurality of projections around said groove adapted to retain a spring for resiliently mounting said outer glass pipe on said bottom lid member to a frame of the solar heat collector.
