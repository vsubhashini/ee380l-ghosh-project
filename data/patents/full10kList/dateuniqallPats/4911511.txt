A light ray radiation stand capable of radiating light rays transmitted through an optical conductor cable in an optical desired direction comprises a foundation, a deformable flexible conduit vertically installed on the foundation, and an optical conductor cable. The optical conductor cable is inserted into the conduit and has one end terminating at the tip end portion of the conduit and another end terminating at the circumferential portion of the foundation through the interior of the foundation. The optical conductor cable is capable of being connected with an optical conductor cable at the side of the foundation. The stand is constructed in such a way that light rays are emitted therefrom at the tip end of the conduit.
Claims I claim: 1. A light rays radiation stand for receiving solar light rays from an optical conductor and for radiating said solar light rays in a desired direction for effecting medical treatment, comprising a foundation stand having two outer parts spaced from one another, a deformable flexible conduit having one end section and an opposite end section, said one section being connected to one of said outer parts of said foundation stand, said conduit extending generally upwardly from said foundation stand, an optical cable disposed partially in said conduit, said cable having one end and one end portion juxtaposed to said one end, said one end portion extending externally of said one end section of said conduit and passing into said foundation stand from said one foundation stand part to said other foundation stand part such that said one end of said cable is juxtaposed to said other foundation stand part, said conductor having a conductor end, connecting means connecting said one end portion of said cable to said optical conductor such that said one end of said cable abuts said conductor end and light rays are transmitted from said optical conductor to said cable, said connecting means comprising a pipe means disposed about said one end portion of said cable, said pipe means having external threads, and a coupling threaded to said pipe means, said connecting means further comprising mounting means mounted on said conductor, said coupling having fastening means engaging said mounting means, said mounting means comprising a tube means disposed about said conductor, said tube means having external threads, a supporting ring means threaded onto said threads of said tube means, and a connecting ring means slidably mounted on said supporting ring means, said connecting ring means having fastening means fastened to said fastening means of said coupling, said cable having an opposite end juxtaposed to said opposite end section of said conduit, said opposite end of said cable constituting a light-rays emitting end such that light rays transmitted from said optical conductor to said cable are transmitted by said cable to said light-rays emitting end and radiated from said light-rays emitting end in said desired direction for effecting medical treatment. 2. A light rays radiation stand according to claim 1, wherein said supporting ring means comprises two supporting ring elements, each element having an end flange stopper to limit the slidable movement of said connecting ring means on said supporting ring means. 3. A light rays radiation stand according to claim 1, wherein said supporting ring means comprises two supporting ring elements each having a slidable portion on which said connecting ring is slidable, each of said elements having an end flange stopper having an outer diameter greater than the outer diameter of each of said slidable portions. 4. A light rays radiation stand according to claim 1, wherein said coupling has one end which is threaded to said pipe means and another end which has said fastening means which is fastened to said connecting ring means. 5. A light rays radiation stand according to claim 1, wherein said other foundation stand part has an opening, said one end of said coupling being disposed in said opening, said other end of said coupling having an outer diameter greater than the diameter of said opening, said other end of said coupling being located externally of said foundation stand. 6. A light rays radiation stand according to claim 1, further comprising adhesive means adhesively securing said tube means to said optical conductor. 7. A light rays radiation stand for receiving solar light rays from an optical conductor and for radiating said solar light rays in a desired direction for effecting medical treatment, comprising a foundation stand having two other parts spaced from one another, said foundation stand having a frusto-conical configuration having a small top end and a large bottom end with said small top end defining one of said two outer parts, a deformable flexible conduit having one end section and an opposite end section, said one end section being connected to said small top end of said foundation stand, said conduit extending generally upwardly from said foundation stand, an optical cable disposed partially in said conduit, said cable having one end and one end portion juxtaposed to said small top end, said one end portion extending externally of said one end section of said conduit and passing into said foundation stand from said small top end of said foundation stand to said other foundation stand part such that said one end of said cable is juxtaposed to said other foundation stand part, said conductor having a conductor end, connecting means connecting said one end portion of said cable to said optical conductor such that said one end of said cable abuts said conductor end and light rays are transmitted from said optical conductor to said cable, said cable having an opposite end juxtaposed to said opposite end section of said conduit, said opposite end of said cable constituting a light-rays emitting end such that light rays transmitted from said optical conductor to said cable are transmitted by said cable to said light-rays emitting end and radiated from said light-rays emitting end in said desired direction for effecting medical treatment. 8. A light rays radiation device comprising solar ray collecting means for collecting solar light rays, an optical conductor for receiving said solar light rays and for radiating said solar light rays in a desired direction for effecting medical treatment, a foundation stand having two outer parts spaced from one another, a deformable flexible conduit having one end section and an opposite end section, said one end section being connected to one of said outer parts of said foundation stand, said conduit extending generally upwardly from said foundation stand, an optical cable disposed partially in said conduit, said cable having one end and one end portion juxtaposed to said one end, said one end portion extending externally of said one end section of said conduit and passing into said foundation stand from said one foundation stand part to said other foundation stand part such that said one end of said cable is juxtaposed to said other foundation stand part, said conductor having a conductor end, connecting means connecting said one end portion of said cable to said optical conductor such that said one end of said cable abuts said conductor end and light rays are transmitted from said optical conductor to said cable, said cable having an opposite end juxtaposed to said opposite end section of said conduit, said opposite end of said cable constituting a light-rays emitting end such that light rays transmitted from said optical conductor to said cable are transmitted by said cable to said light-rays emitting end and radiated from said light-rays emitting end in said desired direction for effecting medical treatment.
