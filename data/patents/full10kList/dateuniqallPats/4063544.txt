A solar energy collector which includes an enclosure within which is located a solar energy-absorbing panel disposed in spaced relation with an overlying glazing, the enclosure being a single sheet of metal fabricated with integral side and end walls, spacing ribs, glaze-holding lips, lock joints and tie down brackets.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar energy collector comprising a rigid sheet-metal boxlike enclosure including a base and integral upstanding side and end walls, the upper edges of said walls having integral portions folded upon one another in spaced relation to provide a channel in their inner sides, a solar radiation transparent glazing mounted over the top of the enclosure with its peripheral edges supported within said channels, a layer of heat insulating material within the enclosure, and a solar radiation absorbing panel within the enclosure and disposed between the insulating layers and the glazing in spaced relation with the glazing, said base of the enclosure having outwardly directed elongated recesses therein and having integral mounting brackets projecting outwardly therefrom. 2. A solar energy collector as set forth in claim 1 wherein means is provided for retaining the panel upon the insulating layer in spaced relation with the glazing to provide a space therebetween. 3. A solar energy collector as set forth in claim 1 wherein said panel is metal and is positioned with its peripheral edges in thermally nonconductive relation with the walls of the enclosure.
