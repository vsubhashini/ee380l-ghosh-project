A method of inline inspection of photovoltaic material for electrical anomalies. A first electrical connection is formed to a first surface of the photovoltaic material, and a second electrical connection is formed to an opposing second surface of the photovoltaic material. A localized current is induced in the photovoltaic material and properties of the localized current in the photovoltaic material are sensed using the first and second electrical connections. The properties of the sensed localized current are analyzed to detect the electrical anomalies in the photovoltaic material.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of inline inspection of photovoltaic material for electrical anomalies without removing samples from the material, the method comprising the steps of: forming a first electrical connection to a top side of the photovoltaic material using a non-physical contact to the photovoltaic material with at least one of a light source and an electron beam, wherein a vacuum for the first electrical connection is formed by mounting a vacuum chamber to a frictionless air bearing that creates a seal between the vacuum chamber and the top side of the photovoltaic material and allows the photovoltaic material to pass freely beneath the first electrical connection, forming a second electrical connection to a bottom side of the photovoltaic material using a physical contact to the photovoltaic material, inducing a localized current in the photovoltaic material, sensing properties of the localized current in the photovoltaic material using the first and second electrical connections, and analyzing the properties of the sensed localized current to detect the electrical anomalies in the photovoltaic material.
