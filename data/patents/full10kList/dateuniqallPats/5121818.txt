A solar powered cooling apparatus for a vehicle brake system utilizing a solar cell panel mounted within a vehicle front bumper to selectively actuate a blower motor located within an air duct housing. The air duct housing is connected to the front bumper of which has a plurality of forward openings with filtering screens so as to direct cool air flowing from the openings to the associated disk brake rotor. A plurality of openings are also formed on the top panel of the bumper of which the solar panel is operatively associated and where the openings can be adjusted via a slide plate operative through a push-pull cable located in a passenger compartment of the vehicle.
Claims What is claimed as being new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent of the United States is as follows: 1. A solar brake cooling apparatus in combination with a self-propelled vehicle, the self-propelled vehicle including a vehicle front bumper positioned forwardly of the vehicle, and a plurality of disc brake rotor and calliper assemblies positioned rearwardly of the vehicle front bumper, and the vehicle front bumper including a plurality of air duct housings, each air duct housing positioned forwardly and in general alignment with an associated disc brake rotor, and the vehicle front bumper including a bumper forward opening, the bumper forward opening including a filter screen directed coextensively therewithin, wherein the filter screen is mounted to a forward terminal end of the air duct housing, the air duct housing including a blower motor mounted therewithin, and a rear terminal end of the air duct housing including a funnel housing, the funnel housing mounting a directional conduit, the directional conduit directed from the funnel housing to a position adjacent an associated disc brake rotor, wherein each air duct housing includes a solar cell panel positioned above each air duct housing mounted within the vehicle front bumper and below a top wall of the vehicle front bumper in electrical communication with the blower motor to direct electrical energy to the blower motor to effect directing of cooling air from the air duct housing through the directional conduit to a respective disc brake rotor. 2. An apparatus as set forth in claim 1 wherein each solar cell panel is mounted below a top panel plate, the top panel plate includes a matrix of openings directed therethrough, and each panel plate is positioned above a respective solar cell panel, and a slide plate mounted between the matrix of openings and the top panel plate, the slide plate including slide plate vanes to effect selective reciprocation of the slide plate vanes relative to the slide plate openings, and a push-pull cable mounted to the slide plate at a forward end of the push-pull cable, and a rear terminal end of the push-pull cable mounted within a passenger compartment of the self-propelled vehicle. 3. An apparatus as set forth in claim 2 wherein the filter screen is mounted within a vertical surface of the vehicle front bumper.
