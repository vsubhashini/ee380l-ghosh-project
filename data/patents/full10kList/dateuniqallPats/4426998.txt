A solar collector unit adapted to be installed between the studs or rafters of a building, the unit comprising one or more strips of thin metal welded to three parallel tubes, the intermediate tube having a bore larger than the bores of the two other tubes and the tubes being connected to headers so that fluid flowing in the two tubes flows through the intermediate tube and so that connections of a fluid source to the tubes is made at one end of the unit. The headers carry brackets by which the unit may be secured to, and supported by, the studs or rafters. The sunlight receiving side of the unit is covered by glazing secured to the building and the opposite side is covered by insulation.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar collector unit installation on a building having an exterior covering supported by spaced structural elements interiorly of said covering, said installation comprising: a solar collector unit mounted between, and secured to, said elements interiorly of said covering, said unit comprising three separate metal strips in side-by-side relation and three tubes, each tube being secured in heat conducting relation to a different one of said strips and being in spaced relation to the other tubes to provide one tube intermediate and spaced from the other two tubes and the combined width of said strips being less than but substantially equal to the spacing between said elements and said unit comprising a pair of headers, one of said headers being disposed at one end of said unit and the other of said headers being disposed at the other end of said unit, the intermediate tube being connected at one end to said one header for fluid flow therebetween and being free of fluid flow connection at its other end to said other header and one end of each of the other tubes being connected to said one header for fluid flow therebetween and the other end of each of the other tubes being connected to said other header for fluid flow therebetween, said intermediate tube having a bore of a cross-sectional area which is at least substantially equal to the sum of the cross-sectional areas of the bores of the other tubes; said exterior covering having a sun energy transparent portion exteriorly of said strip to permit sun energy to strike said strip; insulation material filling the space between said elements which is interiorly of said unit; and means for connecting said other header and said other end of said intermediate tube to a fluid source for circulating a fluid through said tubes and said headers. 2. A solar collector unit for mounting between spaced structural elements of a building, said unit comprising: at least three separate metal strips in side-by-side relation having a combined width less than but substantially equal to the spacing between said elements; at least three tubes, each tube being secured in heat conducting relation to a surface of a different one of said strips and being in spaced relation to each other to provide one tube intermediate and spaced from other tubes and said one tube having a bore of a cross-sectional area at least substantially equal to the sum of the cross-sectional areas of the bores of the others of said tubes; a first header disposed at one end of said strips and connected to the ends of each of said tubes at said one end of said strip for interconnecting said tubes for fluid flow therebetween; a second header disposed at the other end of said strips and connected to the ends of said tubes at said other end of said strips other than the end of said one tube at said other end of said strip for interconnecting said tubes other than said one tube for fluid flow therebetween, the other end of said one tube being disposed adjacent said second header and being free of fluid flow connection with said second header; and means on said second header for connecting said second header to a fluid source for fluid flow between said source and said second header. 3. A solar collector unit as set forth in claim 2 wherein said strips are disposed with overlapping edge portions which have widths which are small relative to the widths of the strips.
