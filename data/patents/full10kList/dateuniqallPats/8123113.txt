This invention provides a roadside mailbox that is installed in a housing that can be wholly or partially buried in the ground. The open top of the housing is closed by a door that is attached to one of the end walls by a hinge, which allows it to be pivotally moved from a closed position where it closes the top of the housing to an open position where it is substantially vertical. The mailbox is so mounted as to be pivotally movable between a secure storage position where it is entirely within the housing and an operational position where it is in position for use. Pivotal movement of the door and the mailbox is accomplished by a mechanism driven by electric power from a battery positioned in the vault, and it is operated by an actuator that can be wireless or hard-wired. A solar panel installed on the door keeps the battery charged. The mailbox also can be laterally movable so that it extends outwardly beyond the door to facilitate depositing and retrieving mail.
