A flange for photovoltaic module frames is disclosed comprising water drainage channels formed by two overlapping flanges, antiwicking grooves in two other overlapping flanges, with nailing slots in the flanges.
Claims I claim: 1. Frame flanges for mounting photovoltaic modules directly to roof structural framing comprising a means for retaining a photovoltaic panel, means for mounting said retaining means directly to roof structural framing, flange means on said retaining means for preventing wicking of water between said modules when said modules are mounted adjacent each other on a roof, and means for preventing drainage of water between modules when said modules are mounted adjacent each other on a roof, thereby permitting the fabrication of an integral roof formed of photovoltaic modules while improving cooling of the modules and decreasing the expense of construction. 2. The frame flanges of claim 1 wherein said means for preventing wicking of water includes at least one groove on an upper edge and one groove on a lower edge of said retaining means. 3. The frame flanges of claim 1 wherein said means for preventing drainage of water between modules includes a first flange on one edge of said retaining means with said first flange having a downwardly projecting outer end, and includes a second flange on an opposite edge of said retaining means with said second flange having a drainage channel ridge to form a drainage channel with the downwardly projecting outer end of said first flange when said modules as mounted adjacent one another. 4. The frame flanges of claim 1 wherein said means for mounting said retaining means includes at least one opening through said retaining means and an attaching means insertable through said opening for attaching the frame flanges to roof structural framing.
