A roof system utilizing a solar cell comprising a first modular roof member composed of a plurality of first light collecting plate segments each of which having a solar cell embedded therein, the first light collecting plate segments being aligned in one direction and in the other direction perpendicular to the one direction; and a second modular roof member composed of a plurality of second light collecting plate segments each of which is equal in size to the first light collecting plate segment, the second light collecting plate segments being aligned in one direction and in the other direction perpendicular to the one direction, the number of the second light collecting plate segments in one direction being larger by one than that of the first light collecting plate segments.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A roof system utilizing a solar cell comprising: a first modular roof member composed of a plurality of first light collecting plate segments each of which having a solar cell embedded therein, the first light collecting plate segments being aligned in one direction and in the other direction perpendicular to the one direction; and a second modular roof member composed of a plurality of second light collecting plate segments each of which is equal in size to the first light collecting plate segment, the second light collecting plate segments being aligned in one direction and in the other direction perpendicular to the one direction, the number of the second light collecting plate segments in one direction being larger by one than that of the first light collecting plate segments, wherein each of said first and said second modular roof members comprises, a framework body consisting of right and left end jambs, a head beam and a sill beam, each of the end jambs having an internal surface to which a corresponding supporting jamb is mounted, the end jambs and beams being formed into a rectangular shape in plane, and composite assembly interfitted to an internal periphery of said framework body, said composite assembly having a transparent substrate beneath which a plurality of light collecting plate segments are juxtaposed, wherein each of the end jambs comprises a vertical wall in which a plurality of flashing protrusions are longitudinally formed at an upper end portion thereof. 2. A roof system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one direction is a lateral direction of a roof and the other direction is a slope direction of the roof. 3. A roof system as claimed in claim 2 comprising: an intermediate connecting member having a width adjusting portion slidably and laterally engaging with a lateral edge of each of said first and said second modular roof member along both external edges thereof; and a lateral connecting member having a width adjusting portion slidably and laterally engaging with a lateral edge of each of said first and said second modular roof member along either one external edge thereof. 4. A roof system as claimed in claim 1, wherein each of the end jambs comprises a vertical wall in which a plurality of flashing protrusions are longitudinally formed at an upper end portion thereof. 5. A roof system as claimed in claim 1, wherein each of the end jambs comprises: a vertical wall to which a horizontal overhanging piece is disposed at an internal surface thereof; a vertical supporting leg disposed at an inner end of said horizontal overhanging piece, said vertical supporting leg extending upward; and ventilation notches formed in said vertical wall and lower ends of said vertical supporting leg closer to the eaves and the ridge. 6. A roof system as claimed in claim 1, wherein a vertical wall is provided with a first fitting bore formed at the end thereof closer to the eaves and a second fitting bore formed at a position closer to the ridge and lower than where said first fitting bore is formed. 7. A roof system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the head beam comprises: a horizontal piece having a strip-like shape, said horizontal piece being extended in a direction perpendicular to a roof slope direction; a riser wall longitudinally disposed on an upper surface of said horizontal piece; a horizontal upper plate parallel to said horizontal piece, said horizontal upper plate being upwardly overhung towards the eaves; a flashing wall disposed by means of bending the end of said horizontal upper plate closer to the ridge; and a fixture engaging piece formed by means of being elongated downward from an lower surface of said horizontal piece and bend towards the eaves and further bend upward; said horizontal piece and said upper plate are so arranged that a lighting plate supporting groove is formed therebetween, said horizontal piece is longitudinally provided with a hollow curved groove formed therein at the end closer to the eaves and is provided with a drain groove formed in an upper surface thereof at a position closer to the ridge. 8. A roof system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sill beam comprises: a lighting plate mounting piece having a horizontal strip-like shape; a lighting abutting wall disposed at an upper surface of an edge of said lighting plate mounting piece closer to the eaves, said lighting abutting wall being slightly smaller in height than said composite assembly; a covering piece overhung from an upper end of said lighting abutting plate, said covering piece being provided with a flashing protrusions at a lower surface thereof and being so formed that a tip thereof is curved downward; and a curved water-proof roof gutter disposed at an edge of said lighting plate mounting piece closer to the ridge, said curved water-proof roof gutter being curved downward to the eaves; said lighting plate mounting piece and said curved water-proof roof gutter are so arranged that a hollow curved groove is formed at a connecting portion therebetween. 9. A roof system as claimed in claim 1, wherein each of the supporting jamb comprises a hollow lighting framework acceptance framework having an inner wall, an outer wall and an external surface, the inner wall being longitudinally provided with a gap at an upper portion thereof, the external surface being provided with a concave groove, and the outer wall being provided with fixing bores formed at both ends thereof.
