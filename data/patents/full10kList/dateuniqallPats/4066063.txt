A device for the transmission of solar energy to a liquid medium is composed of a platelike, flat hollow piece made from a plastics material and being provided with tubular flow channels, which is mounted in a flat-bottomed box under a translucent covering while being insulated.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A device for the transmission of solar energy to a liquid medium including a flat-bottomed box having an open top, a light-permeable cover closing said top and a heat exchanger positioned within said box below said cover, said heat exchanger comprising a relatively flat platelike blow molded element having a pair of generally parallely extending spaced collecting channels formed therein and a plurality of liquid flow connecting channels integrally formed and in communication with said collecting channels, said platelike element being blow molded from an extruded tubular preform made of black pigmented polypropylene and said connecting channels having a diameter of from 5 to 25 mm, a wall thickness of from 1 to 3 mm and being spaced from each other a distance of from 2 to 30 mm. 2. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said box is made from a thermoplastic material. 3. A device as claimed in claim 2, including an insulating layer made from a foamed plastic, positioned between the heat exchanger and box. 4. A device as claimed in claim 2, wherein said box is injection molded. 5. A device as claimed in claim 2, wherein the mounting box is made from integral foam. 6. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said covering is made from polymethylmethacrylate.
