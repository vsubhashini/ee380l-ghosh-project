There is provided in combination with a building roof over an air space requiring forced ventilation of solar energy heated air from the space through a vent hole in the roof, an electrically operated exhaust fan mounted in air exhausting relation on the roof and over the vent hole, and a solar panel for supplying electrical power to a fan driving motor when exposed to solar rays. Air exhaust passage through the device includes a backwash turbulence preventing ring-shape plate extending between a supporting ring body which is of smaller diameter than an exhaust air directing hood on which the solar panel is mounted, and a ring channel member supporting the exhaust fan in a manner to draw the exhaust air through the ring channel into the hood.
Claims I claim as my invention: 1. In a combination for mounting on a building roof having a particular plane and with a vent opening therein: an electrical exhaust fan; means for mounting the fan in air exhausting relation on said roof and over said vent opening; means for supplying electrical power for driving said fan comprising a solar panel supported by said mounting means in a plane which will be in substantially parallel relation to said roof plane so as to face upwardly from the roof; said mounting means comprising a ring-shaped member encircling a channel member of smaller diameter carrying said exhaust fan; radiating arms connecting said channel member and ring-shaped mounting member; and a protective screen extending in a plane overlying said ring-shaped member and said channel member and said radiating arms. 2. In combination according to claim 1; a deflector hood on said mounting means and overlying said fan in free exhaust air passage relation; said deflector hood having a top area and air deflecting skirt means; said solar panel being supported on said top area of the deflector hood and facing upwardly in generally parallel plane relationship to the roof; said deflecting skirt means having reentrant corners; and radiating attachment arms extending between said corners and said mounting means. 3. A combination according to claim 1, wherein asid screen extends between said deflecting skirt means and said mounting means and overlies said attachment arms.
