A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said position detection unit has at least a low-power state and a normal power state, and wherein said position detection unit remains in the low-power state while position information is not being acquired. 3. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said position acquisition apparatus further comprises a battery for providing power to said position acquisition apparatus. 4. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 3, wherein said position detection unit has at least a low-power state and a normal power state, and wherein said position detection unit remains in the low power state while position information is not being acquired, whereby power of the battery is conserved when said position detection unit is in the low-power state. 5. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said position acquisition apparatus further comprises: a communication interface that enables said position acquisition apparatus to transmit data to a remote device via a wireless channel. 6. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 5, wherein the data being transmitted includes at least the position information. 7. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 5, wherein said communication interface transmits the position information to the remote device only when the position information differs from prior position information by at least a second threshold amount. 8. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 7, wherein the second threshold amount is user configurable or dynamic based on a condition of said position acquisition apparatus. 9. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 5, wherein said communication interface has at least a normal power state and a low-power state, and wherein, when the position information differs from prior position information by at least a second threshold amount, said communication interface transitions to the normal power state and then transmits the position information to the remote device. 10. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 9, wherein after said communication interface transmits the position information to the remote device, said communication interface transitions to the low-power state. 11. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 9, wherein said position detection unit is disabled or placed in a sleep mode when in the low-power state. 12. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said position acquisition apparatus further comprises: a battery for providing power to said position acquisition apparatus, and wherein said controller determines how frequent the position information is reacquired by said position detection unit based on at least both the motion identified by said motion monitoring unit and a battery level characteristic of said battery. 13. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein the first threshold amount is dependent on at least one setting or condition associated with said position acquisition apparatus other than motion. 14. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 13, wherein said motion monitoring unit comprises a micro-machined motion indicator. 15. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 13, wherein said motion monitoring unit comprises a mechanical device. 16. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said portable position acquisition apparatus is powered by a battery, and wherein said portable position acquisition apparatus further comprises a solar panel that provides electrical change to said portable position acquisition apparatus. 17. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 16, wherein said solar panel provides electrical charge to said battery. 18. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said position acquisition apparatus further comprises: a communication interface that enables said position acquisition apparatus to transmit data to a remote device via a wireless channel, wherein the position information is processed by said controller to produce processed position information, and wherein the processed position information is transmitted to the remote device 10 said communication interface. 19. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein the motion identified by said motion monitoring unit includes at least one of an acceleration indication, a velocity indication and a vibration indication. 20.
