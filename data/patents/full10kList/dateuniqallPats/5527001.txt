A Modular Communication Satellite (10) for a Satellite Communication System is disclosed. The preferred embodiment of the invention includes a foldable, high-gain, electronically steered antenna array (12) that is always pointed toward the Earth (E). The unfolded spacecraft resemble an oblate flower. Polygonal antenna panels (92, 94, 96, 102, 104, & 106) are attached to each other and to a primary bus structure (22) by antenna deployment hinges (90). The upper portion of the satellite (10) incorporates intersatellite antenna arrays (26) of individual intersatellite antennas (28), which are always pointed tangentially to the Earth (E). An Astromast.TM. boom (32) is mounted between the space facing surface of the primary bus structure (22) and an assembly of solar array storage booms (36). The Astromast.TM. boom (32) can expand and rotate amorphous silicon solar arrays (38) which are unfurled from within the solar array storage booms (36).
