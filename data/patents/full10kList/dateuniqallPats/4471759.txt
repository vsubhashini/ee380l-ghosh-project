The present invention relates to a method of forming a solar collector, or absorber, panels or a heat storage tank, suitable for heating water using solar energy. It also relates to articles of manufacture so formed and to solar water heating apparatus using said articles. Three methods of forming the panel or tank from two sheets of uncured elastic material, such as EPDM rubber, by simultaneously bonding and curing such material around the peripheral edges of the two sheets and at spaced apart, discrete areas over most of the interior areas of the sheets. In one form of the method, one of the sheets is coated with a layer of release agent, over all areas except the discrete areas and the peripheral areas so that only such uncoated areas will bond during cure. In another form, a sheet of non-adherent plastic slightly smaller than the two sheets and having holes or holidays to form the discrete areas is bonded between the two sheets. In a third form, the peripheral edges are first sealed to form a chamber, then the chamber is inflated and a forming die presses together the discrete areas only. Preferably, but not necessarily, reinforcing fibers may be employed or molded, into at least one of the uncured sheets. As articles of manufacture the absorber, or tank, each includes at least one inlet and one outlet at opposed edges of the so formed chamber. Further, the storage tank has a portion of the enclosed volume adapted to receive a heat exchanger. This is made possible by omission of the discrete bonded areas over about one-fourth of the area to the two sheets. In apparatus form, a solar absorption panel and a storage tank so formed (and interconnected inlet to outlet) are mounted back-to-back by an enclosing structure suitable for roof-top or ground-pad mounting and connection into a water system for solar heating of domestic water.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A passive solar water heating apparatus wherein the enclosed fluid circulation system includes a solar heat collector and a tank containing a heat exchanger interconnected by a pair of fluid conduits with at least one of said fluid conduits having a one-way valve therein to prevent back flow of warm fluid from said heat exchanger to said solar heat collector if fluid in said collector is cooler than the fluid in said heat exchanger, which comprises a pair of substantially rectangular inflatable containers respectively forming said solar heat collector and said tank each of said pair of containers being formed of a pair of substantially rectangular sheets of flexible material bonded together around their edges to enclose said inflatable container and said sheets being bonded together at a plurality of spaced apart areas over the enclosed surfaces to provide uniform communication for fluid therein throughout said container, at least one sheet of each container including elongated filaments interwoven with each other and extending across both said bonded areas and the unbonded areas of said sheets to restrict bowing upon inflation of at least one side surface of said container, said solar heat collector container having single entry and single exit conduit connecting means at opposite sides of said collector container, said tank having a portion of the enclosed surfaces between said sheets and adjacent one edge thereof unbonded to permit insertion of a heat exchanger consisting of a closed loop of tubing within a restricted volume of said tank and means for sealing said unbonded edge with said heat exchanger within said chamber, rigid frame means surrounding the peripheral edges of both of said containers to maintain structural dimensions thereof when filled with fluid, and means for mounting said collector and said tank for exposure of said collector to solar radiation. 2. Apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said frame means supports said solar collector and said tank together as a unit and said apparatus includes pivot means for connecting said frame means to said mounting means to permit angular adjustment of said unit relative to incident solar radiation. 3. Method of forming a solar heat collector or storage element having flow passages therethrough which comprises: positioning a separator member between a pair of flexible non-metallic sheet members, said separator member having holes therein to form a plurality of discrete areas of similar size, said discrete areas being similarly spaced apart longitudinally and laterally with respect to each other, bonding said flexible sheet members directly to one another through the holes in the separator member at each of said plurality of discrete areas, embedding tensile filaments in at least one of the flexible non-metallic sheet members to equalize mechanical stresses between the bonded and unbonded areas over both of said flexible sheet members, said filaments also strengthening the at least one member when the resulting unbonded volume between said sheet member is filled with fluid, sealing along each of the peripheral edges of said sheet members to form an enclosed chamber having uniform flow passages along substantially the entire length of opposed ones on said edges to ensure relatively free lateral and longitudinal communication of fluid between said flexible sheet members when the resulting unbonded volume between said sheet members is filled with fluid, said opposed edges enclosing the coextensive edges of said separator member, and forming inlet and outlet passages adjacent two opposed edges of said chamber. 4. Method of forming a solar heat collector or storage element having flow passages therethrough which comprises: bonding a pair of flexible non-metallic sheet members directly to each other at a plurality of discrete areas of similar size, said discrete areas being similarly spaced apart longitudinally and laterally with respect to each other, embedding tensile filaments in at least one of the flexible non-metallic sheet members to equalize mechanical stresses between the bonded and unbonded areas over both of said flexible sheet members, said filaments also strengthening the at least one member when the resulting unbonded volume between said sheet member is filled with fluid, sealing along each of the peripheral edges of said sheet members to form an enclosed chamber having uniform flow passages along substantially the entire length of opposed ones of said edges to ensure relatively free lateral and longitudinal communication of fluid between said flexible sheet members when the resulting unbonded volume between said sheet members is filled with fluid, covering at least one of said flexible sheet members with a bond-inhibiting coating prior to bonding to the other sheet member except over said discrete areas and said opposed edges which are to be sealed, and forming inlet and outlet passages adjacent two opposed edges of said chamber. 5. Method forming a solar heat collector or storage element having flow passages therethrough which comprises: sealing along each of the peripheral edges of a pair of flexible non-metallic sheet members to form an enclosed, inflatable chamber, inflating the chamber, bonding the pair of flexible non-metallic sheet members directly to each other at a plurality of discrete areas of similar size, said discrete areas being similarly spaced apart longitudinally and laterally with respect to each other, the bonding being accomplished by applying pressure to the exterior portions of said flexible sheet members directly overlying said discrete areas to form uniform flow passages along substantially the entire length of opposed ones of said edges to ensure relatively free lateral and longitudinal communication of fluid between said flexible sheet members when the resulting unbonded volume between said sheet members is filled with fluid, embedding tensile filaments in at least one of the flexible non-metallic sheet members to equalize mechanical stresses between the bonded and unbonded areas over both of said flexible sheet members, said filaments also strengthening the at least one member when the resulting unbonded volume between said sheet member is filled with fluid, and forming inlet and outlet passages adjacent two opposed edges of said chamber.
