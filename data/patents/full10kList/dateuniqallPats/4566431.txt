A spontaneous convection type solar heat collector arrangement including a reservoir in which a fluid is disposed. The reservoir includes an upper portion, a lower portion and an inner surface. At least one double-tubing type solar heat collecting tube having an open end and a closed end is positioned within at least one connecting opening provided in the lower portion of the reservoir. Insulating material is operatively positioned around the reservoir for protecting and insulating the reservoir. The open ends of said double-tubing type solar heat collecting tube is positioned in a fixed fluid-tight manner to the connecting opening and is mounted flush with the inner surface of the reservoir for increasing the area of fluid circulation within the reservoir.
Claims We claim: 1. A spontaneous convection type solar heat collector arrangement comprising: a reservoir in which a fluid is disposed, said reservoir including an upper portion, a lower portion and an inner surface; at least one double-tubing type solar heat collecting tube having an open end and a closed end; at least one connecting opening being provided in the lower portion of said reservoir for mounting the open end of said double-tubing type solar heat collecting tube; insulating means being operatively positioned around said reservoir for protecting and insulating said reservoir; said open end of said double-tubing type solar heat collecting tube being positioned in a fixed fluid-tight manner to said connecting opening and being flush with the inner surface of said reservoir for increasing the area of fluid circulation within said reservoir; an externally threaded member positioned within said connecting opening and an internally threaded nut; said double-tubing type solar heat collecting tube being disposed within said externally threaded member and said threaded nut for affixing said open end of said double-tubing type solar heat collecting tube to be flush with the inner surface of said reservoir and a packing member operatively positioned between said externally threaded member and said nut for sealing said tube in said opening of said reservoir. 2. A spontaneous convection type solar heat collector arrangement according to claim 1, and further including a plurality of double-tubing type solar heat collecting tubes and a plurality of connecting openings being operatively disposed in the lower portion of said reservoir.
