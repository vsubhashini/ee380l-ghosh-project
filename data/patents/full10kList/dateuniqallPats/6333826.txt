The present invention relates to an omniramic wide angle optical system which is associated with a camera, projector, medical instrument, surveillance system, flight control system, or similar article. The optical system typically consists of a Cassegrain system having a strongly curved convex reflecting surface with a prolate aspheric figure, a secondary reflector surface, and a modular imaging and correcting lens system. The invention further relates to the distribution of still or motion picture image elements by optical or electronic means, whereby the entire image or any subset thereof is converted from a two dimensional annular image or a segment thereof to a viewable horizontal image or a subset thereof; or, from a horizontal format image or a subset thereof into an annular image or a segment thereof. The present invention also relates to the capture, integration, and display of images having three dimensional information and the capture and presentation of sound and other attributes of real or artificially generated subject matter.
