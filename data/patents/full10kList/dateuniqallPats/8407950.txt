A support system for a solar panel includes a triangular truss with connection points for mounting a photovoltaic module, and a cradle structure that supports the triangular truss and is connected to at least two side supports of the triangular truss. The cradle structure may be driven for rotation about an axis for tracking the sun and several cradle structures can be linked together for tracking movement using a buried linkage system. The truss may also be foldable for ease of transportation and storage.
Claims What is claimed as new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent of the United States is: 1. A support system for a solar panel comprising: a triangular truss with connection areas for mounting at least one photovoltaic module thereon; and a cradle structure adapted to be supported on a foundation and supporting the triangular truss, said cradle structure connected to at least two side supports of the triangular truss, wherein the cradle structure comprises a rotating axis, the support system further comprising: a pair of butterfly drive wings extending from the axis and oriented with an angle of less than 180 degrees between them, the butterfly drive wings configured to rotate about the axis of the cradle structure; and an actuator connected to the pair of butterfly drive wings, wherein the butterfly drive wings are connected to the triangular truss, and wherein the actuator provides a force that rotates the butterfly drive wings about the axis. 2. The system of claim 1, wherein the cradle structure is connected to and supported by the foundation, and wherein the actuator is connected to the foundation. 3. A support system for a solar panel comprising: a triangular truss with connection areas for mounting at least one photovoltaic module thereon; and a cradle structure adapted to be supported on a foundation and supporting the triangular truss, said cradle structure connected to at least two side supports of the triangular truss, wherein the triangular truss is a folding truss that, when in a folded position, occupies less space in at least one direction than when unfolded, and wherein, when the folding truss is in the folded position, a bottom beam of the folding truss, rests against a plurality of top rails of the folding truss.
