A solar lamp drive circuit is arranged to delay start-up while a current is supplied to the lamp filament to warm up the filament. During operation, the back e.m.f. induced in the lamp is sampled, and, if operating conditions deteriorate, the current to the filament is reapplied automatically and the power supply to the lamp increased.
Claims I claim: 1. A lamp drive circuit for connection between a batter power supply and the terminals of a lamp, where the battery power supply incorporates solar cells and a battery, the lamp drive circuit comprising: a. an oscillator; b. a step-up transformer coupled to the oscillator wherein the oscillator and the step-up transformer are arranged to supply high frequency power across the terminals of the lamp; c. a switch connected to one of the filaments of the lamp to control a warm up power supply to the filament; and d. a sampling circuit for monitoring back e.m.f. induced in the lamp connected to the switch for monitoring the operating condition of the lamp, wherein the switch is arranged to turn on if the lamp operating condition deteriorates to a predetermined condition. 2. A lamp drive circuit according to claim 1, further comprising a timer connected to the switch, wherein the timer is arranged to delay the application of power at start-up in order to allow the filament of the lamp to warm up, and wherein the timer further causes the switch to remain closed until after the lamp has been turned on for at least a few seconds. 3. A lamp drive circuit according to claim 2, wherein the oscillator output power is arranged to be reduced from a high starting level to a lower predetermined level once the lamp has been on for a few seconds. 4. A lamp drive circuit according to claim 2, wherein the sampling circuit is arranged to increase the oscillator output power if the lamp operating condition deteriorates from the optimum condition.
