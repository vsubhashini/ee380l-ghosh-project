A construction member comprising a curved metal frame having a conical beam concentrator, an exterior plate glass cover, and an interior plastic wall panel mounted therein and serving as the circular wall panel of a circular building. The concentrator receives an incipient beam of diffused sunlight and refracts a concentrated annular beam onto a conical mirror which reflects a convergent lateral beam inward to the center of the building. A circular conical beam concentrator located in the crawl space refracts the beam twice more and emits a concentrated beam onto a heating element through which domestic hot water circulates.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar wall-panel heating system comprising in general multiple segments of a frusto-conical beam concentrator mounted inside multiple wall panels of a circular building, and a circular conical beam concentrator mounted in the center of the building; the beam concentrators serving as means of receiving a beam of diffused solar radiation and of reducing the beam to a small concentrated convergent lateral beam projected onto a central heating element; and comprising in particular; a solar wall panel (1) having two vertical metal side plates (4) occupying radial planes of the circular building (10), having an exterior plate glass cover (5) mounted to the outer edges of the side plates (4), having a front metal plate (14) mounted to the outer edges of the side plates (4) above and below exterior plate glass cover (5), and having an interior plastic wall panel (6) mounted to the inside edge of side plates (4), side plates (4) having an elongate bracket (3) for mounting the frusto-conical beam concentrator, side plates (4) having a bracket (8) on which is mounted a concave conical mirror; a segment of an annular frusto-conical beam concentrator (2) mounted on elongate brackets (3) and having a series of inset convex conical sections (16) which receive and transmit a convergent conical incipient beam (15) of diffused solar radiation, and having a concave conical section (17) which refracts and emits incipient beam (15), forming concentrated annular beam (18); said concave conical mirror (7) mounted on angular brackets (8) and having a reflective surface which reflects concentrated annular beam (18), forming convergent lateral beam (19) which is projected parallel to the horizontal plane toward the center of circular building (10); a circular conical beam concentrator (9) mounted in the center of circular building (10) and having an outer component lens (23) with a cylindrical section (21) which receives and transmits convergent lateral beam (19), and with two opposed concave conical sections (22) which refract and emit convergent lateral beam (19), forming two concentrated convergent conical beams (24); and having an inner component lens (27) with two opposed convex conical sections (25) which receive and transmit convergent conical beams (24), and with two opposed concave conical sections (26) which refract and emit convergent conical beams (24), forming concentrated convergent lateral beam (28); and a heating element (29) comprising a vertical hot water pipe mounted inside inner component lens (27) of circular conical beam concentrator (9) so as to intercept concentrated convergent lateral beam (28) and absorb the heat thereof.
