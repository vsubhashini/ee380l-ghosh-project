A heat sink in the form of a mesh is interposed between two spaced panes in a window or door light. A combination of holes and passageways formed in the window sash frame members permit the selective establishment of convective air currents past the mesh to absorb the solar converted thermal heat stored in the sink. By manipulating the source of the air for these convective currents (i.e. from the inside or the outside of a building) and by choosing the volume into which the warmed air currents are to be discharged (i.e. inside or outside the building) significant heating and cooling efficiencies are achieved.
Claims I claim: 1. A heating and cooling structure comprising a pair of spaced translucent glazes, a frame for mounting said spaced glazes, said frame having members at two opposite ends of said glazes for engaging said glazes therebetween, passageways formed in said oppositely disposed members to selectively establish fluid communication from either of the sides of said members with the volume established within said frame, a heat sink mounted within said frame between said spaced translucent glazes in order to absorb radiant solar heat applied to said structure and to transfer the heat to said fluid flowing through said volume established within said frame from either of said selected sides of said frame members, said heat sink being a mesh disposed within said frame volume, said mesh being generally coextensive with said spaced glazes, a laterally slidable vent cover received in said frame for movement therewithin, and a plurality of uniformly spaced apertures formed in said vent cover for selective alignment and misalignment with said frame passageways in order to promote and to stop fluid flow between the side of the frame member in which said vent cover is received and the volume established within said frame. 2. A structure according to claim 1 wherein said mesh further comprises a flat black coloring in order to enhance thermal absorption properties of said mesh.
