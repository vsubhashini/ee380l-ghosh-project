An apparatus for collecting solar energy and converting it to electrical energy utilizing solar panels pivotally mounted to a base such that the panels may be pivoted to a storage position inside said base. Additional solar panels may be pivotally mounted on retractable frame trays which stow inside the base when the panels are pivoted to a horizontal position.
Claims I claim: 1. An apparatus for providing electrical energy from a mobile solar energy power source having collapsible solar energy collecting means, comprising: (a) at least one inner solar energy collecting means for collecting solar energy and converting the solar energy into electrical energy, said inner collecting means having an upper end and a lower end; (b) a main base including a front and a back thereof, said main base pivotally mounted to the lower end of said inner collecting means such that said inner collecting means is free to pivot about the mounting axis between 0.degree. and about 90.degree. above the horizontal; (c) at least one inner support member for each inner collecting means, said inner support member having a first end and a second end, the first end of said inner support member pivotally connected in proximity to the upper end of said inner collecting means, said inner support member comprising an inner leg and an outer leg including respective longitudinal axes thereof, the inner leg slidably mated within the outer leg such that the longitudinal axis of the inner leg is longitudinally aligned with the longitudinal axis of the outer leg, the length of said inner support member changeable by sliding the inner leg within the outer leg along their respective longitudinal axes; (d) an inner guide member having a longitudinal axis, said inner guide member attached to said main base such that said inner guide member longitudinally traverses said main base between the front and the back thereof; (e) an inner sliding shoe pivotally connected to the second end of said inner support member, said inner sliding shoe mounted to said inner guide member for movement along said inner guide member between the front and the back of said main base such that movement of said sliding shoe along said inner guide member in combination with the sliding of the inner leg within the outer leg allows positioning of said inner collecting means at an angle between about 0.degree. and about 90.degree. above the horizontal; and (f) means for storing the electrical energy received from the inner solar energy collecting means and supplying the energy to an external receptable. 2. The apparatus for providing electrical energy from a mobile solar energy power source as recited in claim 1, additionally comprising means for transporting the apparatus of claim 1. 3. The apparatus for providing electrical energy from a mobile solar energy power source as recited in claim 2, wherein: (a) the inner leg and the outer leg respectively of said inner support member include a plurality of holes along their respective longitudinal axes, at least one of the holes in the inner leg aligned concentrically with at least one of the holes in the outer leg in order to accept a removable prong therethrough; (b) said inner guide member includes a plurality of holes along its longitudinal axis; and (c) said inner sliding shoe includes a hole therethrough, the hole in the inner sliding shoe aligned concentrically with one of the holes in the inner guide member in order to accept a removable prong therethrough. 4. The apparatus for providing electrical energy from a mobile solar energy power source as recited in claim 1, additionally comprising: (a) at least one outer solar energy collecting means for collecting solar energy and converting the solar energy into electrical energy, said outer collecting means having an upper end and a lower end; (b) at least one outer support member for each outer collecting means, said outer support member having a first end and a second end, the first end of said outer support member pivotally connected in proximity to the upper end of said outer collecting means, said outer support member comprising an inner leg and an outer leg including respective longitudinal axes thereof, the inner leg slidably mated within the outer leg such that the longitudinal axis of the inner leg is longitudinally aligned with the longitudinal axis of the outer leg, the length of said outer support member changeable by sliding the inner leg within the outer leg along their respective longitudinal axes; (c) an outer guide member having a longitudinal axis, said outer guide member attached to said retractable base such that said outer guide member longitudinally traverses said retractable base between the front and the back thereof; and (d) an outer sliding shoe pivotally connected to the second end of said outer support member, said outer sliding shoe mounted to said outer guide member for movement along said outer guide member between the front and the back of said retractable base such that the movement of said outer sliding shoe along said outer guide in combination with the sliding of the inner leg within the outer leg allows positioning of said outer collecting means at an angle between about 0.degree. and about 90.degree. above the horizontal. 5. The apparatus for providing electrical energy from a mobile solar energy power source as recited in claim 4, additionally comprising means for transporting the apparatus in claim 4. 6. The apparatus for providing electrical energy from a mobile solar energy power source as recited in claim 5, wherein: (a) the inner leg and the outer leg of said inner support member and said outer support member respectively, include a plurality of holes along their respective longitudinal axes, at least one of the holes in the inner leg aligned concentrically with one of the holes in the outer leg in order to accept a removable prong therethrough thereby fixing the length of said inner support member and said outer support member respectively; (b) said inner guide member and said outer guide member each include a plurality of holes along their respective longitudinal axes; and (c) said inner sliding shoe and said outer sliding shoe each include a hole therethrough, the hole in the inner sliding shoe aligned concentrically with one of the holes in the inner guide member in order to accept a removable prong therethrough, and the hole in the outer sliding shoe aligned concentrically with one of the holes in the outer guide member in order to accept a removable prong therethrough.
