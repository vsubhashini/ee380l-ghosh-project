Portable solar powered light sources, devices, apparatus, systems and methods of attaching and using the light source. The light sources can have a single small housing having an upper roof portion with an exposed solar cell, a photocell activator, and small housing. The housing can have two parts that pivot with one another so that a front end of the housing can be biased together by a spring, and the rear side having edges that are spaced apart. An operator can press the rear spaced apart edges together, to open the front end to slide about a support structure, such as an open umbrella fabric edge. The housing allows for the light source powered by batteries to be activated by the photocell during dark(night) conditions), with the light direction being adjustable underneath. During daylight, the solar cell receives sunlight to charge the batteries within the housing.
