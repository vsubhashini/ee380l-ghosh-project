A central focus solar energy system consisting of one or more arrays of mirrors, a receiver for each array, a sun tracker, a sun tracker sun acquisition device and a control unit. Mirrors of the arrays are subjected to two-axis control by electromechanical devices actuated by sun-tracking error signals generated by the sun tracker. Mirrors are thus oriented so as to cause reflections of the direct rays of the sun from all mirrors in an array to converge on a receiver at a common focus. Fixed (principal) axes of mirror rotation are parallel to the fixed (principal) axis of rotation of the sun tracker sensor making orientation of the system independent of the earth's spin axis. The system includes a "vernier" or fine adjustment control for positioning mirrors that supplements sun tracker controls.
