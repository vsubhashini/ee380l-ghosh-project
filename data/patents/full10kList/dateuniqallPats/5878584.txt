An air conditioner equipped with a solar generator is disclosed. The solar generator is capable of converting the DC power generated by a solar cell into the AC power whose voltage and frequency correspond to that of the commercial power source. The electrical power generated by the solar cell and the electrical power consumed by the air conditioner are monitored and may be displayed. The DC power generated by the solar cell is used directly by the air conditioner or used indirectly as the commercial power source by merging the converted AC power to the commercial power source. Further, the converted AC power may be selectively merged to the commercial power source depending on the various states of the air conditioner, and the air conditioning operations may be regulated depending on the electrical power generated by the solar cell.
