A self contained deceleration system for a motor vehicle is provided and consists of a housing affixed to rear portion of the motor vehicle. An inertia switch is electrically connected within the housing into a circuit with a power source and a red stop light. When the motor vehicle decelerates the inertia switch will momenterally close allowing the red stop light to illuminate to indicate that the motor vehicle is slowing down.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A self contained deceleration system for a motor vehicle which comprises: (a) a housing: (b) means for affixing said housing to rear portion of the motor vehicle; (c) a first electrical circuit disposed within said housing; (d) a power source electrically connected into said first circuit; (e) a red stop light electrically connected into said first circuit; (f) an inertia switch normally spring biased in an open position and electrically connected into said first circuit whereby when the motor vehicle decelerates said inertia switch will momentarily go into closed position allowing said red stop ligh to illuminate to visually indicate that the motor vehicle is slowing down, wherein said affixing means is a mounting bracket, further comprising; (g) a second parallel electrical circuit disposed within said housing and electrically connected to said power source; (h) an amber test light disposed on said housing and electrically connected into said second circuit; (i) a test button switch normally spring biased in an open position and disposed on said housing and electrically connected into said second circuit so that when said test button switch is manually depressed said second circuit will close allowing said amber test light to illuminate to indicate that said power source is functioning, further comprising an on-off switch electrically connected into said first circuit so that a person can manually turn said first circuit so that a person can manually turn said first circuit on and off when so desired, wherein said power source is a battery, further comprising means for recharging said battery, wherein said recharging means is a solar cell electrically connected to said battery so as to recharge said battery during daylight hours, wherein said inertia switch is electromagnetic to better retain said inertia switch in the closed position whereby reduction of inertia allows the spring to overcome the magnetic force thus returning said inertia switch back to its open position, further comprising: (j) a third parallel electrical circuit disposed between said housing and a dashboard of the motor vehicle and electrically connected to said battery: (k) a remote amber test light electrically connected into said third circuit and disposed into the dashboard; and (l) a remote test button switch normally spring biased in an open position, electrically connected into said third circuit and disposed into the dashboard so that when said remote test button switch is manually depressed said third circuit will close allowing said remote amber test light to illuminate to indicate that said battery is functioning. 2. A self contained deceleration system as recited in claim 1 wherein said third circuit further comprises: (a) a pair of female plugs disposed into side of said housing and (b) a pair of male jacks to mate with said plugs so that said remote amber test light and said remote test button switch can be electrically engaged and disengaged from said battery when so desired.
