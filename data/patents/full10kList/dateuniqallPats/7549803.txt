A condition monitoring system for use in monitoring a generator. The condition monitoring system includes a sensor including an ion chamber located inside the generator for sensing particulates inside the generator. The sensor provides an electrical sensor output to an output converter that is also located inside the generator. The output converter converts the electrical sensor output to a light signal output which is transmitted out of the generator. An energy conversion device is located within the generator for receiving light energy from a light source outside of the generator and converting the light energy to electrical energy for powering the sensor and the output converter.
