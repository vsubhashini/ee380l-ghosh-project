A light transmissive insulation system comprising a plurality of layers of light transmissive insulating material, the material being characterized by transmissivity to solar spectrum radiation, and low transmissivity to thermal radiation. A solar pond employing the insulation system is also described.
Claims We claim: 1. A solar pond comprising a body of liquid material sought to be heated, a layer of solar spectrum radiation transmissive insulation arranged to lie over said body of liquid material in a non-contact spaced relationship therwith so as to form an air gap therebetween, wherein said layer of solar spectrum radiation transmissive insulation comprises an array of cells generally transmissive to solar spectrum radiation and generally opaque to thermal radiation, the array being surrounded by a generally sealed enclosure comprising planar glass panels defining top, bottom and side surfaces and being joined by sealing means, said enclosure including venting apparatus for permitting communication between the interior and exterior of the enclosure, each of said cells in said array having a uniform non-rectangular planar cross section and an aspect ratio which is selected from a range between 5 and 50 to minimize free convection therethrough, the insulation apparatus being configured such that only a single layer of cells is disposed between the liquid material sought to be heated and the sun, said non-contact spaced relationship being provided by a fixed support secured to the bottom of said solar pond for mounting said solar radiation transmissive insulation thereon, said air gap minimizing scale buildup on said enclosure bottom surface and providing insulation against heat loss from the pond. 2. A solar pond according to claim 1 wherein said array of cells comprises a plurality of elongated slanted cells.
