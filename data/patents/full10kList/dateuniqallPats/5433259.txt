A retractable awning includes a weather protective articulated slat system for protecting the awning when in a retracted position with a solar cell panel incorporated into an articulated slat and connected to a battery for charging the battery.
Claims I claim: 1. A retractable awning for mounting on a support surface and movable between an extended and retracted position comprising in combination: an awning canopy having an outer edge and an inner edge, said inner edge being operably connected to said support surface, a roll bar connected to said outer edge so that the awning canopy can be wrapped around the roll bar when the awning is retracted, a supporting framework for selectively retaining the awning in a retracted or extended position, and a panel having solar cells operably connected to said awning canopy for collecting solar radiation and converting the radiation to a usable energy form; said awning canopy including an awning sheet having said inner edge operably connected to said support surface by a plurality of articulated slats adapted to surround the awning sheet and the roll bar when the awning is retracted, and wherein said panel is operably affixed to one of said slats, said slats also comprising a part of said canopy. 2. The retractable awning of claim 1 wherein said solar cells convert solar radiation to electricity and wherein said panel further includes electrical wiring for transferring the electricity to a storage medium. 3. A retractable awning for mounting on a support surface and movable between an extended and retracted position comprising in combination: an awning sheet having an outer edge and an inner edge, said inner edge being operably connected to said support surface by a plurality of articulated slats adapted to surround the awning sheet and the roll bar when the awning is retracted, one of said slats having an outer surface and opposed longitudinally extending recesses along said outer surface, a roll bar connected to said outer edge so that the awning sheet can be wrapped around the roll bar when the awning sheet is retracted, a supporting framework for selectively retaining the awning in a retracted or extended position, and a panel having solar cells operably connected to said awning sheet for collecting solar radiation and converting the radiation to a usable energy form, said panel being received and retained in said recesses so as to overlie said outer surface. 4. The retractable awning of claim 3 wherein said panel is flexible and said one of said slats is arcuate in transverse cross-section.
