An auxiliary member which is inserted into between a roof material and a fixing member including a base portion which is placed on the roof material and has a placement portion, a fixing portion, and a concave groove portion, an erected portion which extends to the upper side from the base portion, and a blocking portion which extends from an upper end of the erected portion to both sides so as to be in parallel with the placement portion and blocks the first frame from being moved to the upper side, includes an engagement convex portion which engages with the groove portion of the fixing member, a main body on which the engagement convex portion is formed on an upper surface, and a concave engagement concave portion which is formed on a lower surface of the main body and is engageable with the engagement convex portion.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An auxiliary member which is inserted into between a roof material and a fixing member including a base portion which is placed on the roof material and has a placement portion on which an outer edge of a solar cell module is placed, a mounting portion which is formed on the lower side with respect to the placement portion and fixes the fixing member onto the roof material, and a concave groove portion which is formed on a lower surface at a position different from the mounting portion, an erected portion which extends to the upper side from the placement portion of the base portion, and a blocking portion which extends from an upper end of the erected portion to both sides so as to be in parallel with the placement portion and blocks the outer edge of the solar cell module from being moved to the upper side, comprising: an engagement convex portion which engages with the groove portion of the fixing member; a main body on which the engagement convex portion is formed on an upper surface; and an engagement concave portion which is formed on a lower surface of the main body and is engageable with the engagement convex portion. 2. The auxiliary member according to claim 1, where in the main body is formed into a laterally long rectangular frame shape and includes a vertical crosspiece extending in the vertical direction in the main body. 3. An auxiliary member which is inserted into between a roof material and a fixing member including a base portion which is placed on the roof material and has a placement portion on which an outer edge of a solar cell module is placed, a mounting portion which is formed on the lower side with respect to the placement portion and fixes the fixing member onto the roof material, and a concave groove portion which is formed on a lower surface at a position different from the mounting portion, an erected portion which extends to the upper side from the placement portion of the base portion, and a blocking portion which extends from an upper end of the erected portion to both sides so as to be in parallel with the placement portion and blocks the outer edge of the solar cell module from being moved to the upper side, comprising: an engagement convex portion which engages with the groove portion of the fixing member; and a main body on which the engagement convex portion is formed on an upper surface. 4. An auxiliary member which is inserted into between a roof material and a fixing member including a base portion which is placed on the roof material and has a placement portion on which an outer edge of a solar cell module is placed, a mounting portion which is formed on the lower side with respect to the placement portion and fixes the fixing member onto the roof material, and a concave groove portion which is formed on a lower surface at a position different from the mounting portion, an erected portion which extends to the upper side from the placement portion of the base portion, and a blocking portion which extends from an upper end of the erected portion to both sides so as to be in parallel with the placement portion and blocks the outer edge of the solar cell module from being moved to the upper side, comprising: a bar-shaped fixing support portion which is fixed to the mounting portion of the fixing member so as to be relatively movable in the vertical direction; and a base member which holds a lower end of the fixing support portion and is fixed onto the roof material.
