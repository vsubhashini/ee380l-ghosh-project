A pair of male and female hinge halves fabricated of extruded metal sections having complemental cross-sectional shapes so as to slidingly interfit and interhookingly engage with one another define a longitudinally extending through opening at one transverse side for the reception of a hinge pin, and interhooking means at the opposite side for interhooking engagement with the complementary shape of an extruded metal frame member of a solar collector frame or the like to be adjustably supported. The interhooking engagement between the hinge halves provides a limited movement fulcrum between the two transverse sides serving to clamp the opposite side interhooking means in secure frictional abutment with the extruded metal frame member when the hinge pin is force-fitted into its through opening.
Claims What I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent is: 1. In a self-clamping hinge for use in pivotally mounting a solar collector panel to a roof or other surface, the combination comprising, a rectangular solar panel framework formed along the outside with hinge interengagement means along its length, a pair of male and female hinge halves each having two mutually opposed ends and being fabricated of extruded metal sections, and having means along their lengths and between their ends operative to slidingly interfit and loosely interhookingly engage with one another, a head portion extending outwardly to one side of said male hinge half at one of said ends thereof, said head portion having an outer surface, the outer surface of said head portion having a first transversely-extending, semi-circular recess, one side of said female hinge half at one of said ends thereof having a second transversely-extending, semi-cylindrical recess defining, together with said first semi-cylindrical recess when said pair of male and female hinge halves are interhookingly engaged with one another, a cylindrical hinge pin opening, said slidingly interfitting means comprising a fulcrum intermediate the ends of said male and female hinge halves upon the sliding interfitting thereof providing for limited mutually rotative motion about said fulcrum of said hinge halves, a cylindrical hinge pin, said cylindrical hinge pin opening being of such size and said hinge pin being of such diameter as to constrain the other of said ends of said male and female hinge halves towards one another about said fulcrum upon the force fitting of said pivot pin within said hinge pin opening, the other of said ends of said male and female hinge halves comprising means for clamping attachment to the hinge interengagement means of the framework upon the sliding interfitting of said male and female hinge halves and subsequent force fitting of said pivot pin. 2. A self-clamping hinge as defined in claim 1 wherein one of said transversely-extending, semi-cylindrical recesses is formed with a plurality of transverse hinge pin gripping projections. 3. A self-clamping hinge as defined in claim 2 wherein said slidingly interfitting means comprises an L-shaped projection extending outwardly of said one side of said male hinge half and receivable in a complemental L-shaped recess in said one side of said female hinge half, and an L-shaped projection extending outwardly of said one side of said female hinge half receivable in a complemental L-shaped opening in said one side of said male hinge half. 4. A self-clamping hinge as defined in claim 1 wherein said slidingly interfitting means comprises an L-shaped projection extending outwardly of one side of one of said hinge halves and receivable in a complemental L-shaped recess in one side of the other of said hinge halves. 5. A self-clamping hinge as defined in claim 4 wherein said clamping attachment means comprises a projection at the other end of each of said male and female hinge halves receivable within the hinge interengagement means of the solar collector panel framework. 6. A self-clamping hinge as defined in claim 5 including a U-shaped bracket defining a recess for the reception of said one end of said male and female hinge halves upon their being slidingly interfitted, said bracket being provided with opposed hinge pin openings for pivotally journalling outwardly-extending end portions of said hinge pin received in said cylindrical hinge pin opening.
