The attitude control is provided under utilization of the solar wind in that the effective surface area of solar panels facing the sun is controlled in accordance with certain rules of asymmetry and under utilization of pulling cable so that an imbalance in received solar pressure is utilized to change the attitude of the satellite.
Claims We claim: 1. Attitude control of a satellite, the satellite being provided with solar panels having a surface experiencing solar pressure, there being means for monitoring the particular attitude the vehicle has, vis-a-vis the sun, the improvement comprising: solar panels extending basically symmetrical in opposite directions from the satellite and are normally coplanar, cable means operatively connected to the extreme ends of said solar panels; said satellite being provided with winches pulling or extending the cable means for distorting and changing the effective surface of the panels to thereby change the effective surface as exposed to the solar radiation in deviation from a coplanar deployment and in a manner that is asymmetrical with regard to at least one of three orthogonal coordinate axes to thereby cause the satellite to turn on account of a residual unbalance, vis-a-vis solar pressure, there being control means connected to the means for monitoring and further connected for operating the winches to obtain the pulling and extending, said control means affecting curvature of said panels individually. 2. Attitude control as in claim 1, wherein said cables are affixed to corner points of the solar panels, and are run in a crossing relation to said satellite. 3. Attitude control of satellite having a first solar panel extending in the one direction from the satellite, and a second solar panel extending in the opposite direction, there being means on the satellite for measuring the attitude of the satellite, vis-a-vis a particular point or line of reference, the combination comprising: a plurality of individually reelable cable leading towards extreme points of the panels, and operated by individual winches to control the curvature of the panels in dependence upon the attitude measuring device. 4. Attitude control for satellite comprising a turning cross mounted on the satellite, and a solar panel mounted on the turning cross having ends connected through cable to portions of the turning cross, there being winches on the turning cross for individually pulling said cable to change the curvature of the respective panel, the turning cross being rotatable in addition on an axis.
