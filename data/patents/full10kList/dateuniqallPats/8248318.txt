A small antenna system for communications on-the-move ("COTM") with a geostationary or geosynchronous satellite to and from a land mobile, maritime or airborne vehicle is disclosed. The antenna system provides a robust and simple means of establishing communications with a satellite or remote computer device. Further embodiments of systems and methods of the various aspects of the present invention mitigate RF losses customary in existing horn antennas. Embodiments also facilitate COTM by utilizing novel antenna configurations that tightly integrate RF electronics while dissipating generated heat via an antenna compartment that may be designed to function as or be used in conjunction with a heat sink.
