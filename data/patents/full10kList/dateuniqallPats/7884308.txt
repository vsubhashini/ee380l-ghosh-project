A power solar panel is maintained in an optimum position relative to the sun during daylight as the sun traverses a solar track elevated above the horizon and extending from a sunrise location to a sunset location during each day of consecutive days of the year by utilizing solar energy to power a sun tracker which carries the power solar panel. The sun tracker includes pairs of solar modules wherein the solar modules are arrayed in an A-shaped cross-sectional configuration for being aimed directly at the sun in response to exposure to the sun, and the pairs of solar modules power motors which tilt the solar panel about a horizontal direction and rotate the power solar panel about a vertical direction to maintain optimum alignment with the sun during the course of a day. Two of the pairs of solar modules are connected alternately to a motor that rotates the solar panel about the vertical direction and are mounted spaced apart in transverse directions, diametrically opposite one another with respect to the vertical direction, and for tilting about lateral directions to aim each of the two pairs toward the solar track such that a first one of the two pairs powers the motor during one day of consecutive days, and the second one of the two pairs powers the motor during a next-consecutive day, thereby compensating for daily changes in the solar track and providing power for effective operation during consecutive days throughout the year.
