Solar heating apparatus that includes a solar panel having a generally rectangular box type frame that is open at the front, glass panes mounted on the frame to close the front opening and provide a dead air space, a plurality of horizontally elongated, generally rectangular tubular channels mounted with the top wall of a lower channel in abutting relationship with the bottom wall of the next higher channel, a water inlet opening through one end of the uppermost channel, a water outlet opening through one end of the lowermost channel, conduits interconnecting the channels to provide a liquid flow path serially through the channels from the uppermost channel to the lowermost channel, a heat storage reservoir, lines including a pump for pumping liquid from a heat exchanger in the storage reservoir to the panel inlet and return the liquid from the outlet to the heat exchanger, control mechanism for operating the pump in response to temperature changes in the panel, and a heat transfer system for transferring heat from the reservoir to a room or other facility to be heated. The rate of liquid flow through the panel is controlled so that only the lower portion of each channel contains liquid, for example water.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. Solar heating apparatus comprising a solar panel having a perimetric frame that has an upper wall, a lower wall, an open front side, and an open back side, first means joined to the frame to close the back side opening, second means that permits passage of infrared rays of the sun mounted on the frame in substantial spaced relationship to the first means to close the front side opening, wall means defining a plurality of horizontally elongated tubular fluid channels with one extending vertically above the other mounted in the frame between the first and second means and spaced from the second means, each channel having a top wall portion, a bottom wall portion, a first end wall and a second end wall, a liquid inlet opening to the interior of the vertically uppermost fluid channel adjacent the first end wall thereof, a liquid outlet opening to the interior of the vertically lowermost fluid channel adjacent one of the end walls thereof, and conduit means opening to interiors of the fluid channels adjacent the end walls thereof other than the ones adjacent the liquid inlet and liquid outlet for interconnecting the channels to provide a liquid flow path between the channels from the liquid inlet to the liquid outlet with the liquid flowing in a direction through a channel that is opposite the direction of flow through the channel immediately vertically therebeneath, means remote from the panel for storing heat energy, and means for conducting liquid from the liquid outlet to the heat storing means and from the heat storing means to the liquid inlet whereby liquid from the heat storing means passes through the liquid inlet and along the liquid flow path to the liquid outlet, the liquid connecting means including means for controlling the flow of liquid through the liquid inlet to maintain liquid in each channel at a level that is a substantial distance below the top wall portion of the respective channel to provide a dead air space in each channel above the level of the liquid in the respective channel. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 further characterized in that the conduit means includes for each channel other than the lowermost channel a discharge opening that opens to the interior of the respective channel vertically more closely adjacent the bottom wall portion of the respective channel than the top wall portion thereof, and includes for each channel an inlet opening that opens to the interior of the respective channel vertically more closely adjacent the bottom wall portion of the respective channel than the top wall portion thereof. 3. The apparatus of claim 2 further characterized in that each of the channels is a generally rectangular metal channel, and that the bottom wall portion of the uppermost channel is in abutting relationship to the top wall portion of the channel vertically therebeneath. 4. Solar heating apparatus comprising a solar panel having a plurality of horizontally elongated, generally rectangular, tubular liquid channels with the channels being one generally vertically above the other, each channel having a first end wall portion, a horizontally opposite second end wall portion, a top wall portion and a bottom wall portion, the bottom wall portion of each channel that is vertically above another being in contact with the top wall portion of the channel immediately therebeneath, perimetric frame means for mounting said channels, means cooperating with the frame means for providing a dead air chamber that opens to the channels, the cooperating means including means that permits passage of infrared rays of the sun to pass through the dead air chamber and impinge on the channels, a liquid inlet opening through the first end wall of the uppermost channel to the interior thereof, a liquid outlet opening through one of the end walls of the lowermost channel to the interior thereof at a location more closely adjacent the bottom wall portion of the lowermost channel than the top wall portion thereof and means for fluidly connecting the channels in series to provide a fluid flow path from the liquid inlet through the uppermost channel and sequentially through each next lower channel to the liquid outlet, the series connecting means having an opening through which liquid is discharged from the respective channel that is more closely adjacent the bottom wall portion of the respective channel than the top wall portion thereof, a heat storage receptacle, and means to conduct liquid from the liquid outlet to said storage receptacle, give up heat energy to the receptacle and conduit liquid to the liquid inlet, and control means connected to the liquid conduit means for regulating the rate of flow of liquid to the liquid inlet to an amount that the liquid in each of the channels remains at a level substantially below the top wall portion thereof. 5. The apparatus of claim 4 further characterized in that the conduit means includes a pump, that the control means includes a control for turning the pump on when the temperature in the dead air chamber exceeds a preselected value and turning the pump off when the temperature in the dead air chamber falls below a preselected value. 6. The apparatus of claim 4 further characterized in that there is provided valve means opening to the uppermost channel to permit air flow thereinto when a vacuum develops therein and permit discharge therefrom when the pressure in the uppermost channel exceeds a preselected value. 7. The apparatus of claim 4 further characterized in that the panel includes means that permits the passage of infrared rays mounted on the frame means to provide a dead air chamber opposite the first dead air chamber from the channels, that the control means controls the rate of flow in the channels to a level that each channel is less than half full of liquid and that each liquid opening and discharge opening for each channel opens only to the lower half of the respective channel.
