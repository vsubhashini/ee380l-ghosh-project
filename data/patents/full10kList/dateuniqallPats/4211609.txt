An apparatus and method for removing contaminants from water having solid contaminants dissolved therein. Contaminated water flows across a grid and into a storage tank. The grid utilizes solar energy to heat that water to a predetermined temperature. A heat transfer structure which is dome-shaped and receives water from the storage tank and a preheater means utilizing solar energy heats the water to a further predetermined temperature. An evaporator means receives the heated water and exposes it to a vacuum condition so that the temperature of the water is above the saturation temperature. The water is thus vaporized, and solid contaminants dissolved therein are separated therefrom. The solids are deposited on a plurality of moving belts and are then moved into a solids removal system. The solids removal system comprises a plurality of trap door pairs upon which the solids are deposited and which are sequentially opened so that the vacuum conditions existing in the evaporator are not disturbed. Vapor transferring means removes the water vapor from the evaporator and transfers it to the heat transfer structure wherein it is condensed to form distillate which is free of solid contaminants. Distillate removal means then removes the distillate from the heat transfer structure to collection or usage means.
Claims I claim: 1. A distillation device comprising: a first water transfer means for withdrawing contaminated water from a body of water having solid contaminants dissolved therein; a grid connected to said first water transfer means so that contaminated water received from said body of water flows across said grid, said grid having an outer peripheral edge and an inner peripheral edge and comprising a header located on said grid outer peripheral edge and fluidly connected to said first water transfer means so that contaminated water flows into said header from the body of water, said header being fluidly attached to said grid so that contaminated water flows from said header onto said grid whereby contaminated water flows from the body of water to said grid via said header, and a trough located on said grid inner peripheral edge and fluidly attached to said grid so that contaminated water flows into said trough from said grid, and means for transferring solar energy to said water flowing across said grid; a water storage means having a side wall attached to said grid trough so that contaminated water flowing on said grid flows into said water storage means via said trough; second water transfer means connected with said water storage means for removing contaminated water from said storage means; a third water transfer means located in said trough and connected to said water storage means for transferring water from said trough to said water storage means and temperature control means connected to said third water transfer means for actuating said third water transfer means when the temperature of said water in said trough reaches or exceeds said predetermined temperature so that only water having a temperature which equals or exceeds said predetermined temperature is transferred to said water storage means; a heat exchange structure connected to said water storage means; a recirculation apparatus mounted in said trough and connected to said header for recirculating said water from said trough back to said header prior to transferring water from said trough into said water storage means and temperature control means connected to said recirculation apparatus for actuating said apparatus when the temperature of said water in said trough falls below a predetermined temperature; a vaporizer means connected to said heat exchange structure for separating said water from said solid contaminants dissolved therein, said vaporizer means having a solar concentrator means for transferring solar energy to said contaminated water flowing from said heat exchange structure into said vaporizer means; vacuum producing means for producing a vacuum in said vaporizer means so that said contaminated water is vaporized under vacuum conditions to form water vapor and thereby separate said water from said solid contaminants, and solid removing means connected to said vaporizer means for removing said solid contaminants from said vaporizer means; water vapor transfer means connected to said vaporizer means for removing said water vapor from said vaporizer means; condenser means connected to said water vapor transfer means for condensing said water vapor to form distilled water which is free of solid contaminants; and distillate transfer means connected to said condenser means for withdrawing condensed water from said condenser means; and mounting means on the distillation device for mounting the solar concentrator adjacent the distillation device; first reflecting means attached to said mounting means; second reflecting means attached to said mounting means; and said first and second reflector means being oriented to reflect solar energy to the vaporizing means for raising the temperature of the water contained in the vaporizing means. 2. The solar concentrator defined in claim 1, further including third and fourth reflecting means mounted on said mounting means for reflecting solar energy to a boiler means associated with the vaporizing means. 3. The solar concentrator defined in claim 2, further including means for moving said reflecting means as the angle of the sun changes with respect to the distillation device. 4. The solar concentrator defined in claim 3, wherein said reflecting means are arranged on both sides of said distillation device.
