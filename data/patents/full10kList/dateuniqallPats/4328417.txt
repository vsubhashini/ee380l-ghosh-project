A mechanism for tracking the sun and positioning a solar energy collector, photovoltaic cells being utilized to energize pairs of electric coils rotatably mounted within magnetic rings. When the sun's rays fall upon a bank of photovoltaic cells a pair of coils are energized, setting up electromotive forces in opposition to the force field of the magnetic ring, and rotating the coils and solar collector mounted thereto.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar tracking mechanism comprising: light response means comprising four batteries of photo voltaic cells, a first battery of cells being focused for sensing light to the right of the sun, a second battery of cells being focused for sensing light to the left of the sun, a third battery of cells being focused for sensing light below the sun, and a fourth battery of cells being focused for sensing light above the sun; means for mounting said light sensitive means for pivotal rotation upon a pair of mutually perpendicular axes, one of said pair of axes being vertical and fixed, the other axis being mounted for pivotal rotation upon the fixed axis; means for rotating said light sensitive means upon said vertical and fixed axis comprising a first ring of permanent magnets having a common polarity on the inside and the opposite polarity on the outside, said first ring being mounted in a horizontal plane coaxial relative to said vertical and fixed axis, and a first pair of coils disposed within said first ring and mounted for pivotal rotation within said first ring upon said vertical and fixed axis; means for rotating said light sensitive means upon said other axis comprising a second ring of permanent magnets having a common polarity on the inside and the opposite polarity on the outside, said second ring being mounted in a vertical plane coaxial relative to said other axis and movable therewith, a second pair of coils disposed within said second ring and mounted for pivotal rotation within said second ring; and means electrically connecting said first and second pairs of coils with said light responsive means, said first pair of coils being rotated within said first ring when either said first or second battery of cells receives light from the sun, said second pair of coils being rotated within said second ring when either said third or fourth battery of cells receives light from the sun. 2. The sun tracking mechanism of claim 1 and further comprising means for inhibiting pivotal rotation of said light sensitive means upon either of said pair of axes. 3. The sun tracking mechanism of claim 2, said means for inhibiting pivotal rotation comprising a pair of electrically operated brakes secured upon said pair of axes, respectively. 4. The sun tracking mechanism of claim 3, and further comprising means for energizing said pair of electrically operated brakes including a wind-driven generator, and means for de-energizing at least one of said pair of electrically operated brakes when the light responsive means is to be rotated upon said pair of axes or one of said pair of axes.
