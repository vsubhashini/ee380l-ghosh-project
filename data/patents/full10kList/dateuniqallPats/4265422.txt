A single pole mounting solar panel assembly comprising at least one solar panel and upper and lower brackets fixed to the panel and to the pole, the upper bracket having a first flange means for mating with the pole and a first base plate fixed to the panel, the lower bracket means having a second flange means fixed to and encompassing a substantial portion of the circumference of the pole and a plane surface which extends out to the panel, the width of the plane surface varying from about the width of the pole to the width of the panel, the flange means for the lower bracket having upstanding side means extending longitudinally of the plane surface for about the full length of the plane surface, the side means and plane surface terminating at a second base plate fixed to the panel.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A single pole mounting solar panel assembly comprising at least one solar panel and upper and lower brackets fixed to upper and lower, respectively, portions of said solar panel and being adapted to be fixed to said pole, said upper bracket having first flange means which encompasses a portion of the circumference of said pole and has means for fixing said flange means to said pole, said first flange means carrying a laterally extending first base plate which is fixed to said panel and angles away from said pole, said lower bracket having a plane surface which extends from said pole to said panel, said plane surface having a width adjacent said pole which is about the same as the width of said pole and which width flares out laterally as said plane surface approaches said panel until such width adjacent said panel approaches the width of said panel, second flange means carried by said plane surface adjacent said pole which flange means encompass a substantial portion of the circumference of said pole and has means for fixing said flange means to said pole, said second flange means having upstanding side means extending longitudinally of said plane surface for essentially the full length of said plane surface, said plane surface and side means terminating in a second laterally extending base plate which is fixed to said panel, said second base plate angles away from said pole to about the same degree as said first base plate, said plane surface being of such length as to hold the lower end of said panel further from said pole than the upper end of said panel. 2. Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said second flange means and said side means all extend downwardly from said plane surface. 3. Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein said first flange means extends upwardly from said first base plate. 4. Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein said second flange means encompasses more than half of the circumference of said pole.
