An improved sun-tracking solar energy collector in constant focal communication with the rays of the sun during daylight hours in which the moving element comprises a lens which focuses the rays of the sun on an indentation of the collector which indentation has a liquid conducting passageway formfitting around it for absorbing the heat of the rays of the sun conducted to it by the lens.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar energy collector comprising: a block of heat absorbing material, at least one lens pivotally mounted on a surface of said block for receiving the rays of the sun, an indentation comprising a spherical configuration formed in said surface of said block juxtapositioned to said lens, said indentation providing clearance for the lens as it is pivoted about its mounting axis, a fluid conducting passageway traversing said block and comprising an expanded portion formfitting around at least a portion of the base of said indentation, said expanded portion comprising an elongated first segment extending in an east-west direction when said block is exposed to the sun and encompassing a greater volume than a second smaller segment extending in a north-south direction substantially perpendicular to said first segment, said first segment receiving a greater concentration of solar energy each day of the year than said second segment, thereby causing the fluid passing through said passageway to more effectively absorb the heat of the walls of said indentation, said passageway comprising inlet and outlet pipes extending into and out of said first segment, and sun tracking means for pivotally rotating said lens to follow the sun. 2. The solar energy collector set forth in claim 1 in further combination with: a second lens pivotally mounted on a surface of said block for receiving the rays of the sun, a second indentation in the surface of said block juxtapositioned to said second lens, said second indentation providing clearance for said second lens as it is pivoted about its mounting axis, a second fluid conducting passageway traversing beneath and formfitting around at least a portion of said second indentation, and means for connecting in series the passageways of the first and second lens to form an array. 3. The solar energy collector set forth in claim 2 in further combination with: means for connecting both lens together, and said sun-tracking means being connected to said means for causing the lenses to follow in unison the movement of the sun. 4. The solar energy collector set forth in claim 1 in further combination with: a plurality of lenses, one for each indentation in said block, each of said plurality of lenses being pivotally mounted on a surface of the associated block for receiving the rays of the sun, a plurality of indentations formed in the surface of said block, one juxtapositioned to each of the lenses, said indentations provide clearances for said plurality of lenses as they pivot about their mounting axes, a plurality of additional passageways traversing beneath and formfitting around at least a portion of each of said indentations, means for connecting the passageway beneath each of said indentations in series, means for connecting said lens and lenses together, and said sun-tracking means being connected to said means for causing the lens associated with each indentation to follow in unison the movement of the sun.
