An apparatus employing cylindrical focusing parabolic mirrors (parabolic troughs) of an optimized configuration capable of being manufactured by techniques of mass production to focus sunlight onto a specifically designed heat pipe which is to carry water or other heat transfer fluid. Focused sunlight energy is absorbed by the pipe, converted to thermal energy and transferred to heat the fluid in the pipe. Groups of mirrors are sequentially arranged so that the fluid in the pipes progressively absorbs more heat as it travels through the heat pipe. At some point in the fluid movement, depending upon the intensity of the specular sunlight the fluid, if liquid, may be converted to vapor. Transfer liquids other than water with higher boiling points may be used within the heat pipe and exit from the heat pipe in the liquid state. In either case, the steam, hot gas or superheated liquid is transmitted to a collector system which is then transported by standard steam pipes enclosed within a silvered glass envelope to a central thermal/electrical generating station. Collector mirror arrays are mounted to permit a single tracking motor to steer a large number of mirrors. All components are optimized for low maintenance and low cost to manufacture.
