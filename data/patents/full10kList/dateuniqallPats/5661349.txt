An electronic device, for example an irrigation controller, accumulates energy from a source of energy, for example from incident light, in order to progress, over time, from an inoperative un-powered to an operative powered condition in a positively controlled, graceful and orderly manner. The device so progresses to operability regardless that it should, from time to time and at times, be totally devoid of energy, and regardless that it may accrue energy only but exceedingly slowly over periods of days, weeks and longer. A power monitor circuit of the device is made from an electrical circuit technology that is reliably operative at a relatively low voltage level, typically from BICMOS technology, whereas other device electrical circuits are operative only at a relatively higher voltage level, and are typically made from CMOS technology. When power is marginal the low-operational-voltage energy monitoring circuit reliably produces one or more status signals well before the other, higher-operational-voltage, circuits even commence to operate. Conversely to its graceful energization, the electronic device degrades and de-energizes gracefully and progressively, in stages. In particular, a microprocessor-based irrigation controller closes all controlled irrigation valves before, in the face of declining energy, reverting first to housekeeping at minimal energy consumption, and then, with further diminishing power, to dormancy. The controller will re-assume full operability should energy balances ever again so permit.
