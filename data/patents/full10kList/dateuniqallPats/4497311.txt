A heating system for buildings such as dwelling houses, office buildings, commercial establishments, industrial establishments, and the like, in which it is desired to maintain a comfortable temperature level during periods when the external air temperature is relatively low. The heating system includes a solar collector mounted on the roof of the building in a manner so that it is exposed to the rays of the sun and pivotally supported and driven by a mechanism so that the solar collector can track or follow the sun as it moves from sun up to sundown. A flexible duct system interconnects the solar collector and the rooms or areas to be heated through a distribution box. The flexible duct extends through a weathertight aperture in the roof to facilitate movement of the solar collector with a check valve and blower being employed in the system to circulate air and to prevent flow of warm air from the rooms into the solar collector at night which may cause condensation in the collector. The solar collector includes double glazing, a plurality of screen grids and a coil or tube assembly provided with projecting fins on opposite sides which areoriented in angular relation to the longitudinal axis of the tubes for more efficient impingement of the rays of the sun thereon thereby providing more efficient collection of the energy of the sun. The collector is provided with an upwardly extending peripheral shield which angulates outwardly for more effective collection of the rays of the sun and also preventing cold air from moving across the surface of the glazing on the collector.
Claims What is claimed as new is as follows: 1. A sun tracking solar air heating system for buildings having a roof and an enclosed space below the roof for receiving heated air from the air heating system, said heating system comprising a solar collector, means mounting the solar collector on the roof in inclined relation for facing the sun, means connected to the solar collector for pivoting the solar collector about an inclined axis to the horizon for tracking the sun across the sky from sun up to sundown and returning the solar collector to an original position during the nighttime, and a flexible duct system connected with the solar collector and extending through the roof for communication with the space to be heated, said flexible duct system being connected to the solar collector and the roof in a manner to maintain the waterproof integrity of the roof and solar collector, said flexible duct system including an enlarged flexible duct having insulating material in the interior thereof, a pair of smaller flexible insulated ducts disposed within the larger duct for circulation of warm air downwardly from the solar collector and upward movement of cold air into the solar collector, said solar collector being of box-like configuration and provided with a heat absorber therein and an open top closed by glazing material to provide a dead air space within the collector and a plurality of screen mesh panels oriented in spaced relation and positioned interiorly of the solar collector for storing heat within the collector and increasing the temperature of the interior of the collector. 2. The structure as defined in claim 1 together with blower means incorporated into said flexible duct system for circulating air between the solar collector and enclosed space. 3. The structure as defined in claim 2 wherein said flexible duct system includes means to prevent air circulation therethrough when the blower means is inactive to preclude entry of heated moist air into the solar collector at night or during cool periods of the day. 4. The structure as defined in claim 1 wherein said means connected to the solar collector for pivoting it for tracking the sun includes a screw threaded member pivotally attached to the solar collector and a timer operated reversible motor connected with the screw threaded member to move the solar collector about an inclined axis as the sun moves across the sky. 5. The heating system as defined in claim 1 wherein said flexible duct system includes gravity actuated dampers to close the air circulating flexible ducts when air is not forced through the ducts. 6. The structure as defined in claim 1 wherein said heat absorber includes a tube assembly defining a plurality of paths of movement for water through the tube assembly, said tube assembly including a plurality of fins of unitary construction therewith and extending laterally therefrom in longitudinally aligned rows and mutually spaced relation with the fins being twisted at the inner ends thereof integral with the tube and including an inclined surface facing the sun for impingement of the sun's rays thereon. 7. The structure as defined in claim 6 wherein said solar collector also includes an upwardly extending shield peripherally of the glazing and extending above the glazing with the shield being outwardly inclined for reflecting sun rays into the interior of the collector to provide more efficient heating of fluids passing through the solar collector and eliminate movement of cold air across the glazing surface of the collector. 8. A sun tracking solar air heating system for buildings having a roof and an enclosed space below the roof for receiving heated air from the air heating system, said heating system comprising a solar collector, means mounting the solar collector on the roof in inclined relation for facing the sun, means connected to the solar collector for pivoting the solar collector about an inclined axis to the horizon for tracking the sun across the sky from sun up to sundown and returning the solar collector to an original position during the nighttime, and a flexible duct system connected with the solar collector and extending through the roof for communication with the space to be heated, said flexible duct system being connected to the solar collector and the roof in a manner to maintain the waterproof integrity of the roof and solar collector, said flexible duct system including an enlarged flexible duct having insulating material in the interior thereof, a pair of smaller flexible insulated ducts disposed within the larger duct for circulation of warm air downwardly from the solar collector and upward movement of cold air into the solar collector, said solar collector including a heat absorber therein, said heat absorber including a finned tube, a pair of flexible pipes connected with said finned tube for circulation of liquid therethrough, said flexible pipes being disposed within said enlarged flexible duct for circulation of heated liquid for use in heating the enclosed space or as domestic hot water. 9. A sun tracking solar air heating system for buildings having a roof and an enclosed space below the roof, said heating system comprising a solar collector, means mounting the solar collector on the roof in inclined relation for facing the sun, means connected to the solar collector for pivoting the solar collector about a vertically inclined axis relative to the horizon for tracking the sun across the sky from sun up to sundown and returning the solar collector to an original position during the nighttime, and a flexible duct system connected with the solar collector and extending through the roof for communication with the space to be heated, said flexible duct system being connected to the solar collector and the roof in a manner to maintain the waterproof integrity of the roof and solar collector, said solar collector being of box-like configuration and provided with an open top closed by glazing material to provide an air space within the collector and a plurality of screen mesh panels oriented in spaced relation and positioned interiorly of the solar collector for storing heat within the collector and increasing the temperature of the air space within the collector, said flexible duct system including an enlarged flexible duct, a pair of smaller flexible ducts disposed within the larger duct for circulation of warm air downwardly from the solar collector and upward movement of cold air into the solar collector. 10. The structure as defined in claim 9 wherein said solar collector includes a finned tube heat absorber in said air space, a pair of flexible pipes connected to the tube and extending through the enlarged flexible duct for circulation of liquid heat exchange medium through the heat absorber.
