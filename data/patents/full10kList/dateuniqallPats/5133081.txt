A remotely controllable message broadcast system includes a Central Programming Station, and many Remote Message Transmitters and repeaters. The Central Programming Station includes a library of broadcast messages and a set of Remote Message Transmitter programming instructions. A transmitter in the Central Programming Station transmits selected broadcast messages from the library and selected Remote Message Transmitter programming instructions from the set to all the Remote Message Transmitters over a wide area transmission network such as a licensed radio link. The transmitted instructions may include global instructions which apply to all Remote Message Transmitters and unique (addressable) programming commands which apply to an individual one of the Remote Message Transmitters. Each Remote Message Transmitter selectively stores received broadcast messages and programming instructions based on whether it is a global instruction or a unique addressable command for that particular Remote Message Transmitter. Each Remote Message Transmitter also includes a local transmitter for locally transmitting sequences of the stored broadcast messages under control of the stored programming instructions. Message sequences may be transmitted as an unlicensed or licensed radio transmission, or may be displayed on an electronic billboard. The Remote Message Transmitters may also transmit the message sequences to one or more repeaters so that each unique message sequence may be directed along particular areas of coverage. Accordingly, a single Central Programming Station may program large numbers of Remote Message Transmitters so that unique message sequences may be broadcast in specific areas of coverage.
