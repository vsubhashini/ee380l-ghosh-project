Apparatus and methods for repelling geese include a solar-powered, photocell controlled flasher for disposition on a body of water or on land where geese inhabit. The method includes the steps of intermittently flashing a light into an area where geese sleep, and disturbing the geese from rest.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. Apparatus for repelling geese and comprising: a flashing light source; a power source including a solar cell for providing electricity from sunlight for energizing said flashing light source in the nighttime; a switch operably connecting said power source to said flashing light source in the nighttime to cause said flashing light source to flash; a housing tube having an upper end and a lower end, said light source mounted proximate said upper end of said housing tube; said solar cell mounted above said flashing light source; a battery disposed in said housing tube below said flashing light source, said battery operatively coupled to said solar cell for charging; a ballast tube having an upper end and a lower end, said ballast tube mounted below said housing tube; a sealing collar coupling the lower end of said housing tube and the upper end of said ballast tube; a float member, said float member disposed proximate the lower end of said housing tube and proximate the upper end of said ballast tube and for floating said apparatus when placed in the water; said housing tube disposed above said float member, with said battery therein disposed above said float member and said ballast tube extending below said float member; and a ballast in said ballast tube for urging said housing tube into an upright position when said apparatus is floated in water. 2. Apparatus as in claim 1 further including a plug in an upper end of said ballast tube isolating said ballast from said housing tube. 3. Apparatus as in claim 2 further including an anchor connector secured to a lower end of said ballast tube. 4. A method of providing apparatus for repelling geese including the steps of: mounting a light source on an upper end of a housing tube for disposition in a nocturnal nesting area of geese; mounting a solar cell above said light source for converting solar energy to electrical energy for charging a battery in said housing tube, said battery operatively and selectively being operatively connectable to a light source when no solar energy is being converted; mounting a float proximate a lower end of said housing tube with an upper end of said housing tube extending above said float; mounting a ballast tube below said housing tube, said ballast tube extending below said housing tube and said float; and placing ballast in said ballast tube; and mounting a sealing collar to a lower end of said housing tube and an upper end of said ballast tube such that said housing tube is disposed above said float member, with said battery therein disposed above said float member and said ballast tube extending below said float member. 5. A method of repelling geese including the steps of: collecting solar energy from a position located above a flashable light source; converting solar to electrical energy; charging a battery disposed below said light source with said electrical energy; selectively connecting said battery to said light source for flashing said light source into a nocturnal nesting area of geese; selectively disconnecting said light source from said battery in the daytime; floating said light source above a water surface by providing a housing tube having an upper end and a lower end, said light source mounted proximate said upper end of said housing tube, said battery disposed in said housing tube below said light source, providing a ballast tube having an upper end and a lower end, said ballast tube mounted below said housing tube, providing a sealing collar coupling the lower end of said housing and the upper end of said ballast tube, providing a float member disposed proximate the lower end of said housing tube and proximate the upper end of said ballast tube, such that said housing tube is disposed above said float member and said ballast tube extends below said float member, and providing a ballast in said ballast tube.
