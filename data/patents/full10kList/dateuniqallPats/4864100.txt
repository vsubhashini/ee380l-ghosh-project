A controlled zone defrosting system is provided for disbursing electrical energy, according to predetermined priorities, to a plurality of defrosting devices, formed of an electrically conductive glass coating material, in an automobile or the like. The defrosting devices could, for example, be effectively located to melt ice formed on such areas as the driver and passenger sides of a windshield, a rear window, etc. The disbursement of electrical energy may, in addition to being dependent on preselected priorities, be made dependent on a number of factors such as time, temperature and the remaining amount of energy. The electrical energy may be supplied by an associated automobile's battery, an independent battery, or an electrical energy generating mechanism such as a photovoltaic device. Available remaining electrical energy may be monitored and, as it is diminished, be disbursed only to zones given top priorities. If a photovoltaic device is used, electrical energy supplied thereby may be disbursed to maintain the charge of an associated battery.
