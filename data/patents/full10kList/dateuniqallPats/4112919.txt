The unit may be mounted either in a window or between the studs of a building that is to be supplied with solar heat. The bottom of the unit extends farther from the building than the top and is wider than the top of the unit such that the transparent side away from the building has an arcuate form and is gradually flared outwardly in a downward direction to increase the exposure to the sun during the day. A plurality of absorptive tubes within the unit are slanted from the upper portion of the unit downwardly and outwardly to the front arcuate portion of the bottom. Openings between the unit and the building are provided for air flow, and a thermostatically controlled fan is mounted in one of the openings. A baffle is mounted between the absorptive tubes and the mounting side of the solar heating unit, and the surfaces of the baffle and the absorptive tubes are painted a dull black for absorbing heat transmitted from the sun through the transparent, slanting side.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar heating unit comprising: a chamber having a mounting side to be attached to a building, an opposite transparent side to be exposed to the sun, and a bottom with an outer edge that is bowed outwardly; said mounting side having upper and lower openings through upper and lower portions respectively of the mounting side to permit flow of air between said chamber and the building to which said solar heating unit is attached, said transparent side facing slantingly upwardly for exposure to the sun, a baffle plate having a slanting portion substantially parallel with said transparent side and an upper portion laterally across said chamber in proximity to said upper opening, said slanting portion to said baffle plate and said transparent side being spaced apart to define a heating space therebetween and each being bowed and gradually flared outwardly in a downward direction, a lower edge of said slanting portion of said baffle being above said bottom to provide a passageway between the bottom of said heating space and said lower opening, a plurality of absorptive tubes, said upper portion of said baffle plate having an opening for each of said absorptive tubes, said absorptive tubes having respective upper ends positioned within respective ones of said openings through said baffle plate, said absorptive tubes extending from said respective openings downwardly and outwardly within said heating space and having respective open lower ends approximate said passageway that communicates with said lower opening, different ones of said openings through said upper portion of said baffle plate being at different distances from a lateral edge of said upper portion of said baffle plate to provide different slants to said respective absorptive tubes and thereby to position walls of different ones of said absorptive tubes nearly perpendicular to the direction of the sun at different times of the day, and said upper ends of said absorptive tubes communicating through partitioned space above said upper portion of said baffle to said upper opening through said mounting side.
