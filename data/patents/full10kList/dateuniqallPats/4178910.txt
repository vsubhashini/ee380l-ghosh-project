The invention involves solar energy collecting units and a system for mounting such units on a support surface. Each unit has a solar radiation collecting panel through which a heat transferring fluid such as water can pass. Each panel can be connected to the panel of adjacent units so that the heat transferring fluid can pass among a series of units as it is being heated. A tapered fluid inlet manifold is provided at one end of the solar collecting panel with a similar tapered fluid outlet manifold at the opposite end. An inlet tube is in communication with the inlet manifold and an outlet tube is in communication with the outlet manifold. Male-female couplings are provided about the respective inlet and outlet tubes so that adjacent solar collecting units can be easily and quickly connected. The tapered manifolds allow the fluid to drain quickly and completely out of whichever end of the collector panel is lower when the panel is not in use. A unique system for coupling the inlet and outlet tubes is provided to allow for expansion and contraction of the units during radical temperature fluctuations. Each solar collecting unit is mounted by flange members extending along the sides of the unit and separate longitudinal clamps to mounting rails aligned in parallel relationship on the supporting surface. The unique mounting system of the invention secures a plurality of the units onto the supporting surface to form an efficient solar energy collecting system. Each unit weighs about the same as standard roofing and the assembly of the units will completely cover and protect the supporting surface.
