A solar tracking device having a plurality of reflector banks for reflecting the sun rays onto collector tubes and heating a fluid circulated therethrough. The reflector banks synchronized to follow the sun during the daily and yearly cycle of the earth as the earth orbits around the sun. The device by accurately following the sun provides a more efficient means of collecting solar energy.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar tracking device mounted on a base, the device collecting heat from the sun and heating a fluid, the heated fluid circulated from the device and used as a heat transfer medium, the device comprising: a reflector bank rotatably mounted on a collector tube, said collector tube disposed adjacent the length of said reflector bank and centered thereon, said reflector bank reflecting the sun rays onto said collector tube for heating the fluid which is circulated through said collector tube; a reflector bank frame, the ends of said collector tube attached to said reflector bank frame, said reflector bank frame supporting said collector tube and said reflector bank thereon, said reflector bank frame being generally semi-circular in shape, the ends of said semi-circular reflector bank frame attached to the ends of said collector tube; first drive means mounted on said reflector bank frame and connected to said reflector bank for rotating said reflector bank one revolution every twenty-four hours so that said reflector bank follows the sun as the earth rotates; a support frame adapted for mounting on the base, said reflector bank frame rotatably mounted on said support frame; and second drive means adapted for mounting on the base and connected to said reflector bank frame for rotating said reflector bank frame on said support frame so that said reflector bank remains perpendicular to the sun during the change is azimuth during the course of one year. 2. The device as described in claim 1, further including a plurality of reflector banks rotatably mounted on collector tubes attached to said reflector bank frame, said reflector banks having a parabolic design for reflecting the sun rays onto said collector tubes. 3. The device as described in claim 1 wherein said second drive means is an azimuth drive gear motor, said azimuth drive gear motor having a drive gear attached to a chain drive, said chain drive connected to a drive pulley, said drive pulley having a gear attached thereto, said gear engaging a gear tooth rack mounted on said reflector bank frame for rotating said reflector bank frame on said support frame. 4. A solar tracking device mounted on a base, the device collecting heat from the sun and heating a fluid, the heated fluid circulated from the device and used as a heat transfer medium, the device comprising: a reflector bank rotatably mounted on a collector tube, said collector tube disposed adjacent the length of said reflector bank and centered thereon, said reflector bank reflecting the sun rays onto said collector tube for heating the fluid which is circulated through said collector tube; a reflector bank frame, the ends of said collector tube attached to said reflector bank frame, said reflector bank frame supporting said collector tube and said reflector bank thereon; first drive means mounted on said reflector bank frame and connected to said reflector bank for rotating said reflector bank one revolution every twenty-four hours so that said reflector bank follows the sun as the earth rotates, said drive means being a twenty-four hour drive gear motor, said motor having a drive gear attached to a chain drive, said chain drive connected to a drive pulley mounted on one end of said reflector bank for rotating said reflector bank on said collector tube, and said motor having an irregular movement in revolving one rotation every twenty-four hours, the irregular movement corresponding with the irregular movement of the earth's yearly orbit around the sun so that said reflector bank continuously follows the sun as the earth rotates; a support frame adapted for mounting on the base, said reflector bank frame rotatably mounted on said support frame; and second drive means adapted for mounting on the base and connected to said reflector bank frame for rotating said reflector bank frame on said support frame so that said reflector bank remains perpendicular to the sun during the change in azimuth during the course of one year. 5. The device as described in claim 4 wherein said twenty-four hour drive gear motor includes a cam plate mounted thereon and having an eccentric surface corresponding with the irregularities of the earth's movement around the sun, said cam plate speeding up or slowing down the output of said twenty-four hour drive gear motor so that said drive gear motor accurately tracks the sun during the irregularity of the earth's orbit around the sun.
