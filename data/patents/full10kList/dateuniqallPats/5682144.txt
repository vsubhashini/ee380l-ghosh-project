This invention is an eyeglass attachable device for automobile and truck drivers for an alertness alarm signal and for related applications, like controlling the steering wheel movements of a vehicle, a car, a truck or a motorized wheelchair, by means of blinking of the the eyes. This eyeglass attachable alarm signal device prevents automobile and truck drivers from falling asleep, while driving. A beam of a narrow band infrared light or a beam of ultrasound is used for sensing, whether the driver's eyelids are closed or are in an open position. A tiny adjustable infrared light emitter carrier, sliding along one of the eyeglasses temples is used for positioning the light emitter on the eyeglasses temple properly for each driver. This positioning can be done also automatically, by means of using a servomotor or electronically, by selecting and switching on continuously just the right beam, which is passing in close proximity of the eyeball.
