A recreational equipment transportation apparatus including a tubular frame with a detachable handle pivotally mounted thereto. A pivotally-mounted first platform receives an ice chest. The top surface of the ice chest defines a second platform on which a recreational equipment compartment (REC) is received. Detachable straps maintain the REC against the frame. A center stake, slidingly received in the frame, and a handle stake, slidingly received in the handle are selectably penetrable in the surface maintaining the apparatus. The center stake prevents the wheels from rolling. The handle stake and the wheels define a stable tripod platform for the recreation site. The invention also provides for shelter including an umbrella, tent, blind and/or netting draped over the frame. The invention also may include batteries and/or solar cells for energizing lamps and/or outlets on the frame. The invention may be transported by any one of a number of locomotive means, e.g., a bicycle.
Claims We claim: 1. A transportation apparatus comprising: a frame having an upper end and an opposite lower end; a handle having an inner end pivotally mounted on said frame at said upper end, said handle including coupling means selectably coupled to an outer end of said handle for coupling said apparatus to a propelled device; an adjustable umbrella pivotally mounted on said frame adjacent said handle; a first and a second wheel rotatably mounted on said frame at said lower end; a suspension mechanism slidably mounted on said frame proximate said lower end, said suspension mechanism having a first and a second leg connected to each said wheel for adjusting the distance between each said wheel; a first platform pivotally mounted on said frame at said lower end; an upper horizontal member and a lower horizontal member, said upper horizontal member being proximate said upper end, said lower horizontal member being proximate said lower end; a center stake selectably penetrable mounting means for slidably mounting said center stake on said frame proximate said lower end, said center stake being selectably penetrable into a ground surface for maintaining said frame in a substantially vertical position; and a handle stake adapted to be slidingly received within said outer end of said handle, said handle stake being selectably penetrable into a ground surface with said handle extending outwardly and downwardly at an angle with respect to said frame when said frame is in said substantially vertical position. 2. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein each said horizontal member is expansible. 3. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 1, including an ice chest supported by said first platform, said ice chest having a panel defining a second platform for supporting items loaded thereon, said upper horizontal member providing lateral support for said ice chest and said lower horizontal member providing lateral support for said items loaded on said second platform. 4. A transportation apparatus as recited claim 1, including: a recreational equipment compartment; and mounting means for mounting said recreational equipment compartment on said frame. 5. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 4, said mounting means for mounting said recreational equipment compartment on said frame comprising at least one detachable strap. 6. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 1, said umbrella having a tent draped thereover. 7. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 1, said umbrella supporting netting. 8. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 1, including supply means for supplying electrical energy mounted on said frame. 9. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 8, said supply means for supplying electrical energy including battery means. 10. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 8, said supply means for supplying electrical energy including solar cell means. 11. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 10, said solar cell means being mounted on said umbrella. 12. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 1, including illumination means for providing illumination mounted on said frame. 13. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 1, said first platform being spring biased toward said frame. 14. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 1, said center stake being spring biased toward said frame. 15. A transportation apparatus as recited in claim 1, said handle having a plurality of tie arrangements and a hook mounted thereon.
