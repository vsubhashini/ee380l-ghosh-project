Recovery of electric power from low-grade waste heat/solar energy, comprising a closed-cycle charged refrigerant loop. Pressurized refrigerant fluid is pumped at ambient temperature through a heat exchanger connected to a waste heat/solar source to extract heat energy during conversion to a high pressure gas. Heated/pressurized refrigerant gas is inlet into an expander to power an output shaft during the expansion of the fluid to a cooled gas at approximately 0 psig. Cooled gaseous refrigerant is condensed to a liquid at low pressure and ambient temperature, and recycled under pressure to the heat exchanger. The expander is a reverse-plumbed gas compressor; the pressurized, hot refrigerant gas is inlet at what is ordinarily its outlet, and the normal inlet becomes the expander end. The refrigerant gas mass flow pressure/temperature drop spins the expander shaft for direct mechanical power take-off, or coupling to a synchronous or inductive generator to produce electricity.
