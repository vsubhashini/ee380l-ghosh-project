A solar energy water heating unit is provided which heats water from a swimming pool by passing the water through a series of spiral hoses mounted on a supporting surface. The supporting surface is mounted on a platform raised from the ground and is cone-shaped to allow for at least a portion of each hose line to be exposed to the sun at all times of the day. The spiral hose lines are mounted in spiral grooves provided on the supporting surface. A pump pumps the water from the swimming pool to the inlet of the hose lines, which inlet is adjacent the lowermost edge of the supporting surface so that the water is always pumped upwardly to the outlet end of the hose lines adjacent the apex of the supporting surface.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar energy water heating device for swimming pools, comprising, in combination, a supporting frame resting upon a stationary surface; at least one hose means arranged in a spiral on said supporting frame; means for mounting said at least one hose means on said supporting frame; and fluid control means for supplying water to and from said at least one hose means, whereby water in the swimming pool, and the like may be heated, wherein said supporting frame comprises a supporting surface for said at least one hose means, said supporting surface sloping from the center thereof downwardly to an edge in all directions thereof, wherein said means for mounting said at least one hose means comprises at least one spiral groove in which is placed said at least one hose means, said at least one spiral groove having a first inlet end adjacent an edge of said supporting surface, and a second outlet end adjacent the center of said supporting surface, said at least one spiral groove extending upwardly along said supporting surface from said first inlet end to said second outlet end along the length thereof, wherein said fluid control means comprises a first inlet pipe having a first end in fluid communication with a source of water to be heated, and a second end in fluid communication with said first inlet end of said at least one hose means; a second outlet pipe having a first end in fluid communication with said source of water to return the water thereto after heating; and a second end in fluid communication with said second outlet end of said at least one hose means; and a pump for pumping water from the source of water through said first pipe means to said first inlet end of said at least one hose means, wherein said means for mounting said at least one hose means further comprises a cross-piece extending from one edge of said supporting surface to another edge of said supporting surface diametrically opposite, said cross-piece passing near the center of said supporting surface and covering a portion of said at least one spiral groove to hold said at least one hose means in said at least one spiral groove, wherein said supporting surface is cone-shaped having said center at its apex, said cross-piece comprising a first portion extending on one half of said cone-shaped supporting surface, and a second portion extending on the other half of said cone-shaped supporting surface, said first portion having a first end adjacent to said first inlet end of at least one hose means, and a second end adjacent said apex; and said second portion having a first end adjacent said apex; and said second portion having a first end adjacent an edge of said supporting surface diametrically opposed to said first end of said first portion, and a second end adjacent to said apex, said second end of said second portion lying near said second outlet end of said at least one hose means. 2. The solar energy water heating device according to claim 1, wherein said means for mounting said at least one hose means comprises at least one spiral groove formed in the top of said supporting frame. 3. The solar energy water heating device according to claim 2, comprising four said hose means, and four said spiral grooves, each said spiral groove being arranged on said top of said supporting frame in a parallel and coextensive manner. 4. The solar energy water heating device according to claim 1, comprising a plurality of said hose means and a plurality of said spiral grooves, each said spiral groove being parallel with and coextensive with the other of said spiral grooves. 5. The solar energy water heating device according to claim 1, wherein said supporting frame comprises a cone-shaped supporting surface, a platform upon which is mounted said cone-shaped supporting surface, and a plurality of vertical supporting beams for said supporting surface, each said supporting beam extending from said platform to said cone-shaped supporting surface. 6. The solar energy water heating device according to claim 1, wherein said means for mounting said at least one hose comprises a first set of spiral grooves formed in said supporting frame, and a second set of spiral grooves also formed in said supporting frame, the distance between corresponding portion of the loops of the spirals in said first set being shorter than the distance between corresponding portions of the loops in said second set.
