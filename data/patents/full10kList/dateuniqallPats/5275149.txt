A polar column solar collector for use in association with a building, the system having a concave mirror located on the exterior of the building and defining a focal point and a central axis, a mounting column secured to the mirror coaxial therewith, a polar axis column, a hinge swingably connecting the mounting column to the polar axis column for moving the concave mirror to aim it directly at the sun at least over a predetermined period of the daylight hours, a secondary reflector located at the focal point of the concave mirror to receive the sun's rays reflected from the concave mirror, an opening in the concave mirror to receive a concentrated beam of the sun's rays reflected from the secondary reflector and to direct the beam along the mounting column, a third reflector movably located at the junction of the mounting column and the polar axis column to receive the concentrated beam of the sun's rays from the secondary reflector reflected through the opening, and to redirect it along the polar axis column, and a polar column rotator for rotating at least a portion of the polar column to track the movement of the sun.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A polar axis solar collector system for use in association with a building located at a predetermined latitude, defining an exterior and interior, and said system comprising; generally concave collector mirror means having front and rear sides and being adapted to be located on the exterior to receive the rays of the sun and defining a focal point; secondary reflector means located on said front side of said collector mirror means substantially at the focal point of said collector mirror means whereby to receive the sun's rays reflected from said collector mirror means and redirect them along a central axis of said collector mirror means; opening means in said concave mirror means to receive said concentrated beam of the sun's rays reflected from said secondary reflector means; a tubular mounting column secured to said collector mirror means coaxial with said central axis of said collector mirror means registering with said opening means in said collector mirror means; a moveable tubular polar axis column portion swingably connected to said tubular mounting column; a fixed tubular polar-axis column portion, said moveable polar axis column portion being rotatably connected thereto and being adapted to be mounted on an axis parallel to the polar axis of the earth, at a predetermined latitude; third reflector means movably located at the junction of said tubular mounting column and said moveable tubular polar axis column portion to receive said concentrated beam of the sun's rays from said secondary reflector reflected through said opening means in said collector mirror means, and to redirect said concentrated beam along said moveable tubular polar axis column portion and said fixed tubular polar axis column portion being adapted to be mounted on an axis parallel to the polar axis of the earth, at a predetermined latitude and extend into said building whereby said beam passes from the exterior to the interior of said building in said fixed polar axis column portion; reflector means about the axis of said fixed tubular polar axis column portion; power means for swinging said tubular mounting column relative to said moveable tubular polar axis column portion, and, means for swinging said third reflector means in unison with swinging of said tubular mounting column. 2. A polar axis solar collector system as claimed in claim 1 wherein said third reflector means is a reflector moveable on an axis transverse to the central axis of said tubular mounting column, and wherein said collector mirror means is moveable on around an arc relative to said fixed tubular polar axis column portion, movement of said third reflector means being co-ordinated with movement of said collector mirror means, whereby to maintain said light beam along a path passing along said fixed tubular polar axis column portion. 3. A polar axis solar collector system as claimed in claim 1 and wherein at least said third reflector means includes cooling means for cooling said third reflector means and means for circulating a cooling medium therethrough. 4. A polar axis solar collector system as claimed in claim 3 and including further cooling means for cooling said secondary reflector means. 5. A polar axis solar collector system as claimed in claim 2 and including gear means collecting said third reflector means to said mounting column means whereby to cause said third reflector means to swing in unison with said mounting column means at a two-to-one reduction as compared with said mounting column means. 6. A polar axis solar collector system as claimed in claim 4 including coolant supply means, connected to one of said secondary and third reflector means, and coolant flow return means connected to the other of said secondary and said third reflector means, and coolant flow connection means connecting between said secondary and said third reflector means. 7. A polar axis solar collector system as claimed in claim 2 wherein said third reflector means is of generally elliptical shape in plan. 8. A method of collecting solar energy and comprising the steps of: directing a generally concave collector mirror along a predetermined path, said mirror defining a focal point, whereby the sun's rays fall upon said mirror and reflect causing said reflected rays to converge at said focal point of said collector mirror; reflecting said rays from a secondary mirror at the focal point of said collector mirror whereby to generate the same into an intensified beam of rays; directing said beam through opening means along said central axis of said collector mirror, and directing said beam from said opening means through mounting column means on to a third mirror; redirecting said beam of rays from said third mirror along a predetermined path enclosed by polar axis column means redirecting said beam of rays from said third mirror along a predetermined path enclosed by polar axis column means mounted at an angle parallel to the polar axis of the earth at the location of said collection mirror; conducting said redirected beam into a building interior, along said polar axis column means; continuously swinging said mounting column means, thereby moving said collector mirror whereby to maintain said path directed constantly at the sun, at least during a predetermined period of the daylight hours, and, intermittently causing angular movement of said mounting column means and of said third mirror relative to said polar axis column means. 9. A method, as claimed in claim 8, wherein said collector mirror is moved in an arc around said polar axis column means whereby to continuously track the position of the sun, at least during a predetermined period of the daylight hours. 10. A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein said third mirror is moveable, about a horizontal axis, in coordination with movement of said mounting column means and is focused along said polar axis column means, whereby to maintain said redirected beam on a predetermined fixed pathway within said polar axis column means.
