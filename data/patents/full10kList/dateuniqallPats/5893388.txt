A water leak detection valve system is provided including a water inlet pipe for receiving an unlimited amount of water. Also included is a water outlet pipe for supplying various water appliances within a building with water. A water valve is connected between the water inlet pipe and the water outlet pipe. The water valve is adapted to preclude the flow of water therebetween upon being closed. Next provided is a water flow monitor device connected between the water inlet pipe and the water outlet pipe. The water flow monitor device serves to monitor the current flow rate of water through the water pipes and further begin a timer upon the beginning of water flow after each cessation of such water flow, wherein the timer continues to track time only as long as water flow continues. The water flow monitor device is further adapted to close the water valve upon certain criteria being met.
Claims I claim: 1. A water leak detection valve system comprising, in combination: a water inlet pipe for receiving an unlimited amount of water; a water outlet pipe for supplying various water appliances within a building with water; a normally enclosed water valve connected between the water inlet pipe and the water outlet pipe, the water valve adapted to preclude the flow of water therebetween upon the deactivation thereof and further allow the flow of water therebetween upon the actuation thereof; a manual valve connected between the water inlet pipe and the water outlet pipe for manually precluding the flow of water therebetween; a first gauge connected between the water inlet pipe and the water outlet pipe for monitoring a total flow of water therebetwen; a water flow monitor device connected between the water inlet pipe and the water outlet pipe downstream of the manual valve and the first gauge, the water flow monitor device adapted to measure the current flow rate of water through the water pipes and further begin a timer upon the beginning of water flow after each cessation of such water flow, wherein the timer continues to track time only as long as water flow continues, the water flow monitor device further adapted to continuously calculate from the measured flow rate of water and time a total volume of water used, whereby upon the total volume of water used exceeding a predetermined amount of water, the water valve is deactivated; a second gauge connected between the water inlet pipe and the water outlet pipe for displaying an amount of water that has flowed therebetween only after a previous cessation of water flow and the timer is begun, wherein the second gauge has a selector function for allowing the selective determination of said predetermined amount of water within a range of 25 to 1500 gallons; a first push button mounted on the water flow monitor device for actuating the water valve upon the depression thereof, wherein the first push button must be depressed after each deactivation of the water flow monitor device in order to resume the flow of water; a second push button mounted on the water flow monitor device for precluding the start of the timer until after water flow begins and a first cessation of water flow occurs upon the depression thereof, thereby temporarily disabling the water flow monitor device; and a power source including a battery for supplying power to the water flow monitor device, the power source further including a solar panel connected to the battery for effecting the recharging thereof upon being exposed to light. 2. A water leak detection valve system comprising, in combination: a water inlet pipe for receiving an unlimited amount of water; a water outlet pipe for supplying various water appliances within a building with water; a water flow monitor device connected between the water inlet pipe and the water outlet pipe, the water flow monitor device, while operating, adapted to calculate a total volume of water used upon the beginning of water flow after each cessation of such water flow, whereby upon the total volume of water used exceeding a predetermined amount of water, the water valve is deactivated; a gauge connected between the water inlet pipe and the water outlet pipe for displaying an amount of water that has flowed therebetween only after a previous cessation of such water flow, wherein the gauge has a selector function for allowing the selective determination of said predetermined amount of water within a range of 25 to 1500 gallons; a first push button mounted on the water flow monitor device for actuating the water valve upon the depression thereof, wherein the first push button must be depressed after each deactivation of the water flow monitor device in order to resume the flow of water; a second push button mounted on the water flow monitor device for precluding the operation of the water flow monitor device until after water flow begins and a first cessation of water flow occurs upon the depression thereof, thereby temporarily disabling the water flow monitor device; and a power source including a battery for supplying power to the water flow monitor device, the power source further including a solar panel connected to the battery for effecting the recharging thereof upon being exposed to light.
