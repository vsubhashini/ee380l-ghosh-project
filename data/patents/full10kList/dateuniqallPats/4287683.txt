A solar shield for room windows reflects and dissipates solar energy by means of a reflective surface and backing piece between which is defined a warm air channel. The backing piece is positioned away from the window surface so that sunlight is admitted between the backing piece and the window being shielded.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar shield for reflecting and dissipating solar energy before said solar energy enters a room's airspace, comprising: (a) reflective surface piece having a reflective surface facing the sun, (b) one or more spacers affixed between the reflective surface piece and a backing piece so that the spacer width creates and defines the width of a warm air channel between the reflective surface piece and a backing piece, (c) a backing piece which is slidably attached to a mounting means and which is affixed to the spacer(s) on the side of the backing piece which faces the sun, and wherein said backing piece defines the exterior surface of an edge light space located between said backing piece and a window being shielded, (d) mounting means for receiving the backing piece and for defining an edge light space between the rear side of the backing piece and the window being shielded. 2. A solar shield according to claim 1 wherein the reflective surface piece is corrugated metal. 3. A solar shield according to claim 2 wherein the width of the spacer(s), and hence the width of the air channel, is from one half to four inches and the width of the edge light space is from one fourth to six inches.
