A solar powered personal fan with a much broader spectrum of both portable and fixed operating applications whereas prior art is application specific. This device also provides a plurality of fixed and portable power supplies. A solar panel, rechargeable battery pack or home charger can all be used as a power supply to operate the present invention.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A portable, solar powered fan comprising: a) a housing having a cylindrical shape with front and rear ends; b) a motor enclosed within said housing; c) a plurality of externally disposed rotary fan blades connected by a shaft along a central axis of said housing extending through said front end in mechanical communication with said motor; d) the rear end of said housing comprising a removable and interchangeable power adapter connected to said housing by threads; e) a rechargeable battery pack for replacing said interchangeable power adapter when said interchangeable power adapter has been removed from said housing, said rechargeable battery pack being substantially cylindrical and aligned with and directly connected to said cylindrical housing, said rechargeable battery pack connected to said housing by threads; f) a solar panel for harvesting solar energy and delivering electric power to said motor, said solar panel connected by a cable to said power adapter; g) a user operated switch externally disposed on said housing for selectively delivering power to said motor; h) an adjustable base member for retaining said fan in a selectively fixed position when hand held operation is not desirable; i) said interchangeable power adapter being substantially cylindrical and aligned with and directly connected to said cylindrical housing providing connection points to operate said fan directly from said solar panel or from the rechargeable battery pack replacing said interchangeable power adapter, said connection points being identical for both direct solar panel usage and said rechargeable battery pack; and j) a leather solar panel protector cover having a clear plastic window over said solar panel, said cover secured to said solar panel with hook and loop fastener elements, said cover having a cable jack recess to provide access to said cable when said cover is installed on said solar panel, said cover further including a belt clip to enable a user to wear said solar panel on an article of clothing for providing solar generated electricity directly to said fan. 2. The portable solar powered fan recited in claim 1, wherein said adjustable base member comprises: a) a semi-circular cradle conforming substantially to the size and shape of said fan housing and releasably encompassing said cylindrically shaped housing for supporting said housing from a side of said housing; b) a base portion; and c) a ball and socket joint connecting said cradle to said base. 3. The portable solar powered fan recited in claim 2, wherein said base member has multiple configurations including: a) a free-standing base member, and b) a base clip member. 4. The portable solar powered fan recited in claim 3, wherein said free-standing clip comprises a substantially circular base portion supporting said ball joint. 5. The portable solar powered fan recited in claim 4, wherein said base portion of said free-standing base member further includes a plurality of hardware recesses for securing said base member to a surface. 6. The portable solar powered fan recited in claim 5. wherein each said hardware recess has a corresponding flexible flap having a first end bonded proximal to said hardware recess and a second end having a plug member for insertion into said recess for aesthetic purposes when hardware isn't used therein. 7. The portable solar powered fan recited in claim 3, wherein said base clip member has a clip base comprising: a) a top plate having a first end and a second end with said ball joint disposed on the top portion thereof and a pair of opposing pivot plates projecting perpendicularly downward from a central portion of the sides thereof; b) a bottom plate having a first end, a second end and a pair of opposing pivot plates projecting perpendicularly upwards, said first end, second end and the pivot plates corresponding with those of said top plate and designed to overlap therewith; c) pivot point connections pivotally connecting said pivot plates, said ball joint being connected to said top plate substantially over an axis of rotation of said top plate; and d) a torsion spring disposed between said pivot plates that are configured to apply a bias against the interior surfaces of said top plate and said bottom plate thereby urging them away from one another and consequently forcing said second ends to clamp down upon each other until the bias is overcome by the user pressing said first ends together to engage and disengage said base clip to an appropriate planar surface. 8. The portable solar powered fan recited in claim 7, wherein said second ends of said top plate and said bottom plate have a vulcanized rubber coating to prevent the lateral movement thereof when clipped to a planar surface. 9. A method of operating a cooling fan comprising the steps of: a) enclosing a motor for said fan in a housing having a cylindrical shape with front and rear ends, with a plurality of externally disposed rotary fan blades connected by a shaft along a central axis of said housing extending through said front end in mechanical communication with said motor, and the rear end of said housing comprising an interchangeable power adapter substantially cylindrical and aligned with and directly connected to said cylindrical housing via threads; b) using a solar panel for harvesting solar energy and delivering electric power to said motor, said solar panel connected by a cable to said power adapter, a user operated switch externally disposed on said housing for selectively delivering power to said motor; c) using said interchangeable power adapter to provide connection points to operate said fan directly from said solar panel, removing said interchangeable power adapter, replacing said interchangeable power adaptor with a rechargeable battery pack, connecting said rechargeable battery pack to said housing via threads, said connection points being identical for both direct solar panel usage and said rechargeable battery pack; and d) mounting said solar panel in a leather solar panel protector cover having a clear plastic window over said solar panel, said cover secured to said solar panel with hook and loop fastener elements, said cover having a cable jack recess to provide access to said cable when said cover is installed on said solar panel, said cover further including a belt clip to enable a user to wear said solar panel on an article of clothing for providing solar generated electricity directly to said fan.
