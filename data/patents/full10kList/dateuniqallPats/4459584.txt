An automatic liquid level indicator and alarm system (10) that automatically emits an alarm when liquid in a vessel reaches a preselected low or high level. The system (10) is particularly adaptable for use on petroleum storage tanks (50) of the type found on petroleum tank farms. The system (1) comprises a low-level and a high-level permanent magnet (10) (11); a low-level and a high-level magnetic sensor (24) (25); an encoder-RF transmitter (15) (16); an RF receiver-decoder (18) (19); an alpha-numeric display (20) and an audible alarm (21). The magnets (10) (11) are attached to an existing movable tape (31) whose position at any instant is relative to the position of a float (41) within the tank (50). The magnets (10) (11) are located at positions indicative of the preselected low or high level marks. When either magnet (10) (11) is juxtaposed with its respective sensor (24) (25) a signal is transmitted by the encoder-RF transmitter (15) (16) and is received by the RF receiver-decoder (18) (19) located at a remote monitor station. The signal is displayed on the display (20) and simultaneously the alarm (21) is energized to alert station personnel of the incoming signal.
