A light ray radiation device according to claim 2, wherein said hook means comprises a hook member, a second hinge pivotably mounting said hook member on said pressing plate, said other side wall of said receiving member having an upper end, a hook-engaging means mounted on said upper end of said other side wall, said hook member being pivotal to a hook-engaging position in which said hook member engages said hook-engaging means to cause said pressing plate to press said cable in said cable receiving member. 4. A light ray radiation device according to claim 3, wherein said hook means further comprises a stop plate pivotably mounted on said second hinge, a spring means on said stop plate, said other side wall of said receiving member having a spring-engaging means which is spaced from said hook-engaging means, said stop plate being pivotal to a closed position wherein said stop plate overlies said hook member and said spring means is resiliently received between said spring-engaging means and a hooked end part of said hook member when said hook member is in said hook-engaging position. 5. A light ray radiation device according to claim 4, wherein said hook-engaging means comprises a pin mounted on said upper end of said other side wall of said receiving member, said hooked end part engaging said pin when said hook member is in said hook-engaging position. 6. A light ray radiation device according to claim 5, wherein said spring means comprises a generally U-shaped member having a base and two spaced legs extending from said base, said base being fixed to said stop plate, said two spaced legs being resiliently retained between said spring-engaging means and said hooked end part when said hook member is in said hook-engaging position and said stop plate is in said closed position. 7. A light ray radiation device according to claim 1, wherein each of said cable support means has a generally V-shaped configuration. 8. A light ray radiation device according to claim 1, wherein each of said cable support means has a generally semicircular configuration. 9. A light ray radiation device according to claim 1 further comprising mutually perpendicular handles extending from said cable support means. 10. A light ray radiation device comprising an elongated optical conductor cable for transmitting the visible light ray component of solar rays, a supporting stand for supporting said optical conductor cable, said support stand comprising a pedestal, a plurality of spaced upright poles fixed to said pedestal, a support fixture slidably and rotatably mounted on said poles, a support arm fixed to said support fixtures and extending perpendicular to said poles, a cable support means slidably and rotatably mounted on each of said support arms, one of said cable support means receiving and engaging a first section of said cable, another of said cable support means receiving and engaging a second section of said cable, said first section being longitudinally spaced from said second section, whereby the position and orientation of said cable can be varied by independently sliding and rotating either one of said support fixtures on its respective pole, by independently sliding and rotating either one of said cable support means on its respective support arm, and by sliding and rotating said cable in each of said cable support means, each of said cable support means comprising a cable receiving member having a closed bottom part and side walls extending from said bottom part, said side walls being spaced from one another and extending generally upwardly from said bottom part, said side walls generally converging towards one another as said bottom part is approached, said cable being received between said side walls in a position overlying said bottom part, one of said side walls having an upper end, said cable support means further comprising a pressing plate, said cable supporting means further comprising a first hinge on said upper end of said one side wall for pivotably mounting said pressing plate between a closed pivotable position in which said pressing plate engages and presses said cable in said cable receiving member and another open pivotable position which enables said cable to be inserted and removed from said cable receiving member, said cable supporting means further comprising a hook means for detachably connecting said pressing plate to said other side wall of said receiving member, said hook means comprising a hook member, a second hinge pivotably mounting said hook member on said pressing plate, said other side wall of said receiving member having an upper end, a hook-engaging means mounted on said upper end of said other side wall, said hook member being pivotal to a hook-engaging position in which said hook member engages said hook-engaging means to cause said pressing plate to press said cable in said cable receiving member, said hook means further comprising a stop plate pivotably mounted on said second hinge, a spring means on said stop plate, said other side wall of said receiving member having a spring-engaging means which is spaced from said hook-engaging means, said stop plate being pivotal to a closed position wherein said stop plate overlies said hook member and said spring means is resiliently received between said spring-engaging means and a hooked end part of said hook member when said hook member is in said hook-engaging position. 11.
