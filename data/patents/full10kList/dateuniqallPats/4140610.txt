A PN junction type solar battery comprising a plurality of alternate P-type and N-type semiconductor layers provided in a laminated manner parallel to an incident-light-receiving plane, connection ears provided opposite to each other and integrally connected to one end of each of the P-type and N-type semiconductor layers respectively, the connection ears being made of material of the same conduction type as the semiconductor layers respectively, and terminal electrodes mounted on the connection ears of the P-type and N-type semiconductor layers respectively so as to obtain ohmic contact therebetween. A method of producing a PN junction type solar battery in which P-type and N-type semiconductor layers are formed on a substrate in a staggered manner relative to each other preferably by the ion-beam deposition method or the cluster-ion-beam deposition method.
Claims What is claimed as new and desired to be secured by letters patent of the United States is: 1. A method of producing a PN junction type solar battery comprising the steps of setting a mask on a substrate, said mask having a semiconductor-layer-forming opening corresponding in size to the shape-in-plan of a semiconductor layer, forming a semiconductor layer of given conductivity type on said substrate within the opening of said mask, setting a mask similar to said mask on said semiconductor layer on said substrate and at a position slightly shifted from that of said mask so that an opposite type semiconductor layer is formed at a slightly staggered position on said semiconductor layer, repeating the above steps to form a plurality of alternate P-type and N-type semiconductor layers on said substrate in a laminated manner, and mounting terminal electrodes on connection ears in ohmic contact therewith respectively, said connection ears being formed by the staggered formation of said P-type and N-type semiconductor layers. 2. The method of producing a PN junction type solar battery as set forth in claim 1, wherein the steps of forming the P-type and N-type semiconductor layers are performed by either of the ion-beam deposition method and the cluster-ion-beam deposition method.
