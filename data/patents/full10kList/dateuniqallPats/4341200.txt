Improved solar collector sub-assemblies and combinations thereof includes corner-locking piece sub-assemblies, top glazing clamping member sub-assembly, collector plate mounting member sub-assembly and collector assembly mounting means, all adapted to facilitate assembly and installation of collectors in accordance with the present invention and to permit thermal expansion of components thereof.
Claims I claim: 1. Solar collector assembly including: solar collector mounting member and mating solar collector housing mounting means, said member comprising a U-shaped channel having an elongated bolt hole in the central leg thereof and aligned shaft holes in the side legs thereof, said means comprising an exterior shaft receiving channel along a side of said housing, said channel said channel having slots therein perpendicular to the length of said channel and space to receive the side legs of said U-shaped channel member, and a shaft in said shaft-receiving channel projecting through the holes of said U-shaped channel member; a spring loaded solar collector top glazing and seal locking means including a solar collector side member having an upwardly facing top glazing receiving member inward of the collector side and an upward projection outward of said glazing receiving member including an outwardly faced spring receiving tip and an upwardly pointing locking tip, and said means further including a spring member extending along the length of said member with a locking dog adapted to engage said outwardly faced spring receiving tip and a vertical channel adapted to receive, upon slight deflection of said spring member, said upwardly pointing locking tip, said deflection in turn urging downwardly an inward projection of said spring member and thereby adapted to clamp a top glazing member against said upwardly faced top glazing receiving member of said collector side member; solar collector housing corner mating side members with corner locking means, said side members having inward projections along the length thereof near the top and bottom thereof, said inward projections adapted to receive and retain therein a corner locking piece having two angularly disposed legs, each of which fits into the inward projections of one of said corner mating side members; and means for mounting a rectangular collector plate in a solar collector housing comprising, along two opposite edges of said plate, spring clips fastened to said plate and slidingly retained above and below said plate so as to permit slight lengthwise movement of said clips fastened to said plate and along one of the remaining edges of said plate, spring clips fastened to said plate and slidingly retained only above said plate, and along the other of said remaining edges of said plate, fastening means fastened to said plate and to the adjacent side member of said collector housing.
