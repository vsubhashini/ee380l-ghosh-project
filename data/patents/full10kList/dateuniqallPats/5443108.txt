A Venetian blind consisting of a plurality of slats, a movable head, two string ladders one each attached proximate the first and second ends of the movable head and a stationary bottom unit, two fully extended vertical alignment strings one each attached proximate the first and second ends of the stationary bottom unit and extending vertically through holes in the plurality of slats and the movable head up to the receiving cavity of a stationary upper member and attached thereto, a draw string connected to the movable head and extending through a draw string holding mechanism mounted in the stationary upper member for varying the collapsed height of the plurality of slats and a tilt adjusting mechanism contained in the movable head for varying the tilt of the uncollapsed height of slats is described. The Venetian blind will provide privacy against line-of-sight viewing by persons external to the dwelling while at the same time allowing full passage of ambient light and thermal radiation through the upper portions of the window. The blind, which is designed to be upwardly extended from a collapsed height in the lower portion of a window framework, is designed to permit full entry of thermal radiation and ambient light through all daylight hours of the day.
Claims I claim: 1. A window blind that is deployed from the bottom of a window comprising: an upper member mounted at the top of a window, said upper member having one aperture proximate the respective ends of the upper member and a downwardly facing cavity that extends substantially the full length of the upper member; a drawstring holding mechanism incorporated in said cavity of the upper member; a movable head assembly with one aperture juxtaposed near each end of said movable head assembly with the geometrical centers of said apertures of the movable head assembly collinear with the geometrical centers of said apertures of the upper member; a plurality of slats having one oval hole proximate the respective ends of said slats with the geometrical centers of said oval holes collinear with the geometrical centers of the apertures of the movable head assembly; two string ladders with extended top and bottom terminal ends comprising front and back ladder strings connected by cross strings at equal intervals for supporting the slats with said cross strings distant from said extended top and bottom terminal ends of said string ladders; a slat tilt mechanism incorporated in the movable head assembly operably attached to the top terminal ends of said string ladders for tilting the slats; a bottom unit mounted in the lower portion of a window with said bottom terminal ends of the string ladders mechanically attached thereto proximate the respective ends of said bottom unit; alignment strings attached to the bottom unit and extended vertically through said oval holes in the slats, the apertures in the movable head assembly, and said apertures in the upper member where said alignment strings are mechanically coupled to the upper member for maintaining the horizontal axes of the slats and movable head assembly in a vertical plane; and, drawstring means, for varying the vertical position of the movable head and concurrently the disposition of the slats within a window, rigidly attached to the movable head and extending upward into the cavity of the upper member and through said drawstring holding mechanism where said drawstring means depends in a downward direction. 2. The window blind of claim 1 wherein said drawstring means consists of a looped string whose ends are attached, one each, proximate first and seconds ends of the movable head. 3. The window blind of claim 1 wherein said slat tilt mechanism is composed of a metal rod with a driven gear of a worm gear set and two plastic spools slidably mounted and fixed, as by adhesive, on said metal rod. 4. An improved Venetian blind providing line-of-sight privacy and passive solar heating comprising: a bottom unit; an upper member mounted in the upper portion of a window having a cavity which extends substantially the full length of the lower portion of said upper member; a drawstring holding mechanism operably mounted in the upper member; a movable head assembly with one alignment hole positioned proximate each end of said movable head assembly; a plurality of slats having oval holes at each of their first and second ends; two string ladders with extended top and bottom terminal ends with cross strings therebetween for supporting the first and second ends of said slats; a bottom unit mounted in the lower portion of a window; two alignment strings extending through said oval holes in the slats and the alignment holes in the movable head assembly that are attached, under tension, to said bottom unit and said upper member; tilting means mounted in the interior of said movable head assembly for tilting the slats in a counterclockwise or clockwise direction relative to a horizontal plane; and, a looped drawstring attached to the first and second ends of said movable head assembly and extended vertically substantially parallel to said alignment strings into the cavity of the upper member and subsequently through said drawstrings holding mechanism; means connected to the upper member for mounting said blind within the framework of a window; and means connected to the bottom unit for mounting the blind within the framework of a window. 5. A blind deployed from the bottom of a window comprising: an upper member; a bottom unit; a movable rail, with alignment holes proximate the first and second ends of said movable rail; two string ladders with extended top and bottom terminal ends comprising from and back ladder strings connected by cross strings at equal intervals with said extended top terminal ends of said string ladders mechanically attached to the movable rail; a plurality of slats with alignment holes at their first and second ends supported by said cross strings of the string ladders; two vertical alignment strings attached to said upper member and extended through said alignment holes in said movable rail and said slats and mechanically attached to said bottom unit; One or more drawstrings attached to the movable rail; and slat tilting means mounted in the bottom unit and attached to the second ends of two tilt strings whose first ends extend up beyond the cross strings of said string ladders proximate the movable rail where said tilt strings are attached to said front and back ladder strings of the string ladders for rotating the slats in a clockwise or counterclockwise directions.
