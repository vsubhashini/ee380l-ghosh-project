An apparatus and method for removing contaminants from water having solid contaminants dissolved therein. Contaminated water flows across a grid and into a storage tank. The grid utilizes solar energy to heat that water to a predetermined temperature. A heat transfer structure which is dome-shaped and receives water from the storage tank and a preheater means utilizing solar energy heats the water to a further predetermined temperature. An evaporator means receives the heated water and exposes it to a vacuum condition so that the temperature of the water is above the saturation temperature. The water is thus vaporized, and solid contaminants dissolved therein are separated therefrom. The solids are deposited on a plurality of moving belts and are then moved into a solids removal system. The solids removal system comprises a plurality of trap door pairs upon which the solids are deposited and which are sequentially opened so that the vacuum conditions existing in the evaporator are not disturbed. Vapor transferring means removes the water vapor from the evaporator and transfers it to the heat transfer structure wherein it is condensed to form distillate which is free of solid contaminants. Distillate removal means then removes the distillate from the heat transfer structure to collection or usage means.
Claims I claim: 1. A process for distilling water and separating the water from solids dissolved therein, comprising the steps of: withdrawing contaminated water from a body of water having solid contaminants dissolved therein; flowing contaminated water from said body of water into a header which is fluidly connected to an outer peripheral edge of a grid; flowing contaminated water from said header onto said grid via said header; transferring solar energy to said water flowing across said grid; flowing contaminated water into a trough which is located on said grid inner peripheral edge which is fluidly attached to said grid, from said grid; flowing contaminated water from said grid via said trough into a water storage means having a side wall attached to said grid trough and having a heat exchange structure connected thereto; removing contaminated water from said storage means; transferring water from said trough to said water storage means; monitoring temperature of water in said water storage means; transferring only water having a temperature which equals or exceeds a predetermined temperature to said water storage means; recirculating said water from said trough back to said header prior to transferring water from said trough into said water storage means when the temperature of said water in said trough falls below a predetermined temperature; flowing water from said heat exchange structure into a vaporizer means connected to said heat exchange structure, and for separating said water from said solid contaminants dissolved therein; concentrating solar energy on the contaminated water flowing from said heat exchange structure into said vaporizer means; using solar energy, raising to a second predetermined temperature said contaminated water flowing from said heat exchange structure into said vaporizer; vaporizing said contaminated water in said vaporizer under vacuum conditions to form water vapor; separating said water from solid contaminants in said vaporizer means; removing said solid contaminants from said vaporizer means; removing water vapor from said vaporizer means; transferring said water vapor to a condensing means; exposing said contaminated water in the vaporizing means to said water vapor and transferring heat from said water vapor to such contaminated water to preheat same; circulating such preheated contaminated water in a circuitous path; condensing water vapor and forming distilled water which is free of solid contaminants; and withdrawing condensed water from the proximity of said water vapor.
