Claims What is claimed is: 1. A skylight comprising: a skylight body portion; means on said body portion for mounting said skylight upon a ceiling; said skylight body portion supporting an element which transmits infrared, visible and ultraviolet solar radiation; at least one light transmissive blocking element mounted in said skylight which blocks UV-B radiation whereby it is movable between a position entirely blocking said elements and a position allowing the element to transmit al radiation; and means for moving said blocking element relative to said transmitting element to a variety of positions to control the amount of radiation emanating from the skylight. 2. A skylight according to claim 1 wherein said skylight includes at least one fixed blocking element which blocks UV-B radiation vertically spaced from said movable blocking element. 3. A skylight according to claim 2 wherein the means for moving said blocking element comprises a lead screw. 4.
