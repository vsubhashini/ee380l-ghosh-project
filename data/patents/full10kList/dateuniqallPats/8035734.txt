A self-balancing remote sensing device, and a system comprised of the remote sensing devices and one or more base stations, is provided for remotely monitoring both terrestrial and maritime environments. Specifically, a spherically-shaped self-balancing remote sensing device having one or more cameras and various sensors is provided, which may ascend and descend within the water column as desired, by altering its buoyancy, while maintaining proper orientation of the camera and sensors. Further, the remote sensing system comprised of the devices and base stations is provided, wherein the devices and base stations may form an ad hoc network, thereby greatly extending the range and coverage of the system. The devices, due to their small size, may be quickly and easily deployed using various vehicles, including flight vehicles, land-based vehicles, water craft, and subsurface water vehicles.
