An improved louvered apparatus for the regulation of solar light and heat radiation through windows and the like, is disclosed. The unique configuration of the present invention is innovative, simple, and a considerable improvement over the conventional louvered apparatuses. Some of the various features of the present invention, which are described, herein, include precise very low frictional operation, apparatus is maintenance free, a compact design, uncomplicated fast two-bracket installation, available in the standard manual, or optional remote electronic actuation, and apparatus has been designed to be manufactured inexpensively.
Claims I claim: 1. An apparatus for regulating the passage of solar light and heat radiation through a window; said apparatus comprising: a center mullion member integrally coupling a plurality of overlapping, interconnected, louver plate members, pivotable about a parallel axes; said center mullion member having U-shaped cross section; said center mullion member having a plurality of apertures therethrough, accommodating therein said louver plate members; the plurality of said louver plate members fixedly mounted to a plurality of louver plate axle members; a plurality of bearing members fixedly mounted in said apertures of said center mullion member for pivotal mounting therein, the plurality of said louver plate axle members; a pivot arm member operably coupled to the plurality of said louver plate axle members, for a simultaneous opening closing adjustment of the plurality of said louver plate members; an adjusting lever member, is fixedly mounted to said louver plate axle member, adjacent to an adjustment opening, in said center mullion member; a louver plate adjusting hand tool member, for manually adjusting, opening closing, of the plurality of said louver plates; a cover plate member, fixedly mounted to said center mullion member, to shield the pivoting joints, of said apparatus from direct sun impingement; and a framing means fixedly mounted to the interior peripheral of the window opening, and adjacent to an interior surface of window glazing, for preventing direct solar radiation from entering a peripheral area between said window opening and said apparatus. 2. The apparatus for regulating the passage of solar light and heat radiation through a window, as in claim 1, wherein the elements of said apparatus are selected from a group of aluminum alloys. 3. The apparatus for regulating the passage of solar light and heat radiation through a window, as in claim 1, wherein said louver plate axle member is of a square cross sectional shape. 4. The apparatus for regulating the passage of solar light and heat radiation through a window, as in claim 1, wherein said center mullion member, independently, accommodates all articulate elements of said apparatus. 5. An electronically operated apparatus for regulating the passage of solar light and heat radiation through a window; said apparatus comprising: a center mullion member for integrally coupling a plurality of overlapping, interconnected, louver plate members, pivotable about a parallel axes; said center mullion member having a U-shaped cross section; said center mullion member having a plurality of apertures therethrough accommodating therein said louver plate members; the plurality of said louver plate members fixedly mounted to a plurality of louver plate axle members; a plurality of bearing members fixedly mounted in said apertures of said center mullion member for pivotal mounting therein, a plurality of said louver plate axle members; a pivot arm member operably coupled to the plurality of said louver plate axle members for simultaneous, opening or closing adjustment of the plurality of said louver plate members; an adjusting lever member, is fixedly mounted to said louver plate axle member, adjacent to adjustment opening in said center mullion member; an electronic actuator, is operably coupled to said adjusting lever member for automatic, and simultaneous, opening or closing, of the plurality of said louver plate members; a remote controller, is, thereby the remote means for controlling a selected percentage of, opening or closing, of the plurality of said louver plate members; a cover plate member fixedly mounted to said center mullion member for shielding the pivoting joints, of said apparatus, from direct sun impingement; and a framing means fixedly mounted to the interior peripheral of the window opening, and adjacent to the interior surface of the window glazing, for preventing direct solar radiation from entering the peripheral area between said window opening and said apparatus. 6. The electronically operated apparatus for regulating the passage of solar light and heat radiation through a window, as in claim 5, wherein the elements of said apparatus, excluding said electronic actuator and said remote controller, are selected from a group of aluminum alloys.
