A reflective solar tracking system of the type arranged to reflect light rays from the sun onto a remote solar energy collector is described. The system comprises a reflector mounted on an assembly incorporating a drive mechanism for rotating the reflector about two axes to compensate for altitudinal and azimuthal changes in the position of the sun. A sensor device is adapted to point at the sun and provide control signals to the drive mechanism so that the reflector is moved in response to solar movement such that sunlight is always reflected onto the collector and at the same time the sensor device is moved so as to track the sun.
Claims It is claimed is: 1. A reflective solar tracking system for reflecting light rays from the sun onto a remote solar energy collector, the system comprising: a reflector for reflecting light rays from the sun onto said collector; a mounting assembly for mounting said reflector relative to said collector so that said reflector is rotatable about a first axis pointing at the collector, and about a second axis transverse to the first for controlling elevational tilt of said reflector; sensor means for pointing at the sun and sensing directional changes in the sun's position, said sensor means including means for producing control signals in response to said directional changes; said mounting assembly including means for mounting said sensor means so that it is rotatable about said first axis to control its azimuthal pointing direction and about a third axis parallel to said second axis for controlling its altitudinal pointing direction; and a drive mechanism for rotating said reflector and sensor means about the respective axes of rotation in response to said control signals so that said sensor means tracks the sun and said reflector moves so as to reflect light rays from the sun onto the collector; said mounting assembly comprising a cylindrical member adapted to be fixed in position to point along said first axis through the center of the plane of said reflector, and a sleeve rotatably mounted on said member, a mounting shaft for said reflector extending transversely along said second axis through said sleeve and being secured to said reflector on opposite sides of said sleeve, said shaft being rotatably mounted in said sleeve to control tilt of said reflector, said reflector having an opening extending transverse to said shaft through which said sleeve projects to point at said collector. 2.

The system of claim 4, in which both said pairs of sensors are arranged on the interior surface of a tube of rectangular cross section, the central axis of said tube adapted to point axially towards the sun, said pairs of sensors being operatively linked to said drive mechanism such that a first control signal produced by a comparison of the light intensities incident on each sensor of said first pair of sensors causes said sensor means to rotate about said third axis through an angle equal to twice the angle through which said reflector is rotated, and second control signal produced by a comparison of the light intensities incident on each sensor of said second pair of sensors causes said rotatable member to rotate about said first axis, with a consequent rotation of said sensor means and said reflector. 6. The system of claim 5, in which said drive mechanism comprises: a first drive means controlled by said first control signal for rotating said reflector and said sensor means about said second and third axes, respectively, in a respective 1 to 2 drive ratio; and a second drive means controlled by said second control signal for rotating said rotatable member. 7. The system of claim 6, in which said mounting assembly comprises a cylindrical member adapted to point at said collector along said first axis and said rotatable member comprises a sleeve rotatably mounted on said cylindrical member, said drive mechanism being mounted within said sleeve, a mounting shaft for said reflector extending transversely through said sleeve and being secured to a rear face of said reflector on opposite sides of said sleeve, said mounting shaft axis comprising said second axis, said sensor array being mounted on one end of a support rod, the opposite end of said support rod being pivotally mounted in said sleeve about said third axis, said first drive means being arranged to rotate said sleeve on said cylindrical member and said second drive means being arranged to rotate said reflector mounting shaft about said second axis and said support rod about said third axis in a 1 to 2 drive ratio, respectively. 8. The system of claim 2, wherein said sensor means includes at least one sensor assembly comprising an elongated chamber adapted to point in the direction of the sun and two spaced rectangular arrays of solar cell sensors mounted at opposite ends of said chamber, each rectangular array comprising a first pair of solar cell sensors mounted in the walls of said chamber so as to face each other in a first direction, and a second pair of solar cell sensors mounted so as to face each other in a second direction perpendicular to the first, one of said pairs of each array comprising said altitudinal direction chamber detecting means and the other of said pairs comprising said azimuthal direction change detecting means, and means are provided for activating the upper one of said arrays when the sun is positioned to one side of the assembly so that said upper array acts as a coarse positioning means, and means are provide for de-activating said upper array and activating the lower one of said arrays when sunlight is directed into said chamber, such that said lower array acts as a fine positioning means, the sensors of each array being connected to a comparator device for comparing signals from the sensors of each pair of the activated array and producing a control signal in response to a difference in said signals. 9. The system of claim 8, wherein said activating means includes a solar sensor cell mounted in the lower end of said chamber and adapted to produce a control signal to de-activate said upper array and activate said lower array when sunlight is incident on said cell. 10.
