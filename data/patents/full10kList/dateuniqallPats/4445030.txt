A solar energy collecting system of the tracking type is disclosed herein and includes at least one but preferably a plurality of solar panels mounted for movement along respective predetermined tracking paths such that each maintains a predetermined orientation with respect to the sun as the latter moves across the sky. The disclosed system also includes a single, common device which serves both as a direct insolation monitor for detecting the presence or absence of direct sunlight and as a means of detecting the position of the sun if direct sunlight is found to be present. Each panel includes a second device mounted for movement therewith for sensing the position of the panel at any given time and, at the same time, for detecting whether or not the panel is at the desired orientation with the sun.
