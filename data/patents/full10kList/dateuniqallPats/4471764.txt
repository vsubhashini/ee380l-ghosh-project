A solar collector assembly is provided comprising an absorber means adapted to transfer heat to a fluid, a solar energy transmitting cover member, and a housing adapted to receive said cover member and to contain said absorber means, said housing having a bottom wall and foot sections adapted to receive an after-defined elastomeric mounting means; and elastomeric mounting means being fastened to said foot sections and being adapted to cooperate with a fastener means associated with a mounting bracket to movably secure said housing to said bracket.
Claims We claim: 1. In a solar collector incorporating an absorber means adapted to transfer heat to a fluid and a solar energy transmitting cover member, the improvement comprising: a housing adapted to receive said cover member and to contain said absorber means, said housing having a bottom wall and foot sections forming a plurality of receptacles and having sidewalls tapered such that said housing is at least partially nestable within another such housing; and elastomeric mounting bodies positioned in said receptacles and fastened to said foot sections, said elastomeric bodies having an insert bonded thereto, said insert having a fastener receiving section, said bodies having an external layer of elastomeric material extending beyond said insert such that the external layer contacts the bottom wall of another such housing when said housing is nested therewithin. 2. A solar collector assembly comprising: an absorber means adapted to transfer heat to a fluid; a solar energy transmitting cover member; a housing adapted to contain said absorber means, said housing having a collar section extending around the periphery thereof; sealing means adapted to be located at the collar section of the housing; a clamping means adapted to extend along the collar section to substantially uniformly bias the cover member toward the collar section of the housing, said housing having a bottom wall and a plurality of spaced-apart foot sections having receptacles therein and having sidewalls tapered such that said housing is at least partially nestable within another such housing, and elastomeric mounting bodies adapted to be positioned in said receptacles and fastened to said foot sections, said elastomeric bodies having an insert bonded therein, said insert having a fastener receiving section, said bodies having an external layer of elastomeric material extending beyond said insert such that the external layer contacts the bottom wall of another such housing when said housing is nested therewithin. 3. The solar collector assembly of claim 2 wherein said elastomeric mounting bodies are mechanically fastened to said foot sections and wherein said insert has a threaded sleeve. 4. The solar collector assembly of claim 2 wherein said elastomeric bodies have an orifice extending therethrough adapted to receive a pin adapted to extend at least partially through said foot sections to fasten said elastomeric bodies to said foot sections.
