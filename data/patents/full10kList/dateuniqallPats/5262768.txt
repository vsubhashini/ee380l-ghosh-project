An apparatus wherein an anchor housing includes pivotally mounted side and end walls that are released upon manipulation of a cover lid clasp and upon projection of an upper end wall projection into a lower end wall cavity to effect dispensing of a pressurized gas into an associated balloon to project above the anchor housing, with a flasher unit mounted to the balloon medially thereof in operative association with a rechargeable battery and solar panels to effect continuous recharging of the battery. A windlass housing is secured to the individual, with an associated windlass crank arm to effect selective release of a container tether line mounting the anchor housing to the windlass housing.
Claims What is claimed as being new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent of the United States is as follows: 1. A rescue beacon apparatus, comprising in combination, a signal balloon, the signal balloon including a central support plate, and the central support plate mounting fixedly a flasher bulb housing thereon, wherein the flasher bulb housing includes a flasher bulb therewithin, and an anchor housing arranged in a first closed configuration to contain the signal balloon therewithin, wherein the anchor housing is opened to a second configuration from the first configuration to effect release of the signal balloon, and the anchor housing including a container tether line, wherein the tether line includes a first distal end secured to the anchor housing, and the container tether line includes a second distal end, and a windlass housing, the container tether line second distal end mounted to the windlass housing, and wherein the windlass housing includes a windlass housing rear wall and windlass housing forward wall, the windlass housing rear wall includes a clip member mounted thereon for securement of the windlass housing to an individual, and wherein the windlass housing forward wall includes a crank arm rotatably directed through the windlass housing forward wall, and a winding reel rotatably mounted within the windlass housing, wherein the crank arm is arranged for rotation of the winding reel, and wherein the container tether line is directed through the windlass housing and wound about the winding reel to effect selective winding and reeling of the container tether line about the winding reel, and the signal balloon includes a torroidal balloon member formed with a central opening, the central support plate mounted within the central opening, and the signal balloon including a plurality of balloon mounting loops circumferentially mounted about a periphery of the balloon member, and each of the mounting loops including a tether line, and each tether line joined to the anchor housing interiorly of the anchor housing, and the anchor housing includes a rigid base container, the rigid base container including a base container floor, and the base container floor including a mounting loop, wherein the mounting loop is arranged for securement of the container tether line forward distal end, and the base container floor including a first lower side wall and a second lower side wall, and a first lower end wall and a second lower end wall to define the base container, and the first lower side wall including a first upper side wall hingedly mounted to the first lower side wall about a first side wall hinge, and the second lower side wall including a second upper side wall hingedly mounted to the second lower side wall about a second side wall hinge, and the first lower end wall including a first end wall hinge hingedly mounting the first lower end wall to the first upper end wall, and the second lower end wall including a second upper end wall hingedly mounted to the lower end wall about a second end wall hinge, wherein each hinge is arranged in a coplanar relationship relative to one another, and wherein the first end wall hinge and the second end wall hinge are arranged parallel relative to one another, and the first side wall hinge and the second side wall hinge are arranged parallel relative to one another, and the first upper end wall includes a first end wall cover lid obliquely and fixedly mounted to the first upper end wall, and the second upper end wall includes a second end wall cover lid obliquely and fixedly mounted to the second upper end wall, and the first end wall cover lid and the second end wall cover lid are positioned between the first upper side wall and the second upper side wall in the first configuration, and wherein the first end wall cover lid and the second end wall cover lid include a cover lid clasp to effect securement of the first end wall cover lid and the second end wall cover lid together maintaining the anchor housing in the first configuration, whereupon release of the first end wall cover lid relative to the second end wall cover lid by release of the cover lid clasp permits maintaining of the anchor housing to the second configuration, and the first upper end wall includes an upper end wall projection spaced from the first end wall hinge a predetermined spacing, and the first lower end wall includes a lower end wall cylindrical cavity spaced below the first end wall hinge a further spacing equal to the predetermined spacing, and the first upper end wall projection is receivable within the lower end wall cylindrical cavity upon opening of the anchor housing to the second configuration, and the signal balloon includes an inflation gas canister mounted to the torroidal balloon member, wherein the torroidal balloon member and the inflation gas canister are positioned within the anchor housing in the first configuration, and the inflation gas canister is slidably mounted within the lower end wall cylindrical cavity, and a piercing rod fixedly mounted within the inflation gas canister coaxially aligned with a forward terminal end of the inflation gas canister, whereupon projection of the upper end wall projection into the lower end wall cylindrical cavity permits communication with the upper end wall projection with a rear terminal end of the inflation gas canister and permits projection and piercing of the gas canister by the piercing rod, and the anchor housing includes a base container partition wall mounted within the base container and spaced from the first lower end wall fixedly mounting the piercing rod, and an upper terminal end of the partition wall is arranged for securement of each balloon tether line, and a circuit control panel mounted within the base container, and a flasher unit mounted within the base container and a rechargeable battery mounted within the base container, wherein the battery, the flasher unit, and the circuit control panel are in electrical communication with the flasher bulb to effect selective flashing of the flasher bulb, and a normally opened switch in contiguous communication with the balloon member in the first configuration, whereupon release of the balloon member relative to the base container in the second configuration effects closing of the switch to direct electrical energy to the flasher bulb, and at least one solar panel mounted to an interior surface of each upper side wall, wherein each solar panel is in communication with the rechargeable battery to provide for recharging of the battery upon opening of the anchor housing to the second configuration.
