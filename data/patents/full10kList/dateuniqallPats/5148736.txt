An automatic solar-powered car ventilator to be installed between the upper horizontal bar of the window sash and the upper horizontal edge of a movable window glass in a window in a car door having a main body and two auxiliary bodies extending from both sides of the main body to be cut to suit the width of the movable window glass. A ventilating means including a fan, a motor to drive the fan to suck in the open air and exhaust out the air in the car. A base to mount the fan and the motor and a housing to shield the fan, the motor and the base. A solar-energy board being combined with the main body or the ventilating means by means of two clamps on the board movably catching hold of either two holders on the main body or on the ventilating means to generate electricity to power the motor by absorbing the sunlight.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An automatic solar-powered car ventilator comprising: a main body being positioned between the upper horizontal bar of a window sash and the upper horizontal edge of the movable glass in a window in a car door, having (1) an air outlet at its front lower section. (2) a glass groove at its rear bottom edge for the upper horizontal edge of a movable glass in a window in a car door to fit in, (3) a rectangular plate at its rear upper section, (4) a wing plate extending from both side ends of the rectangular plate and having several holes, (5) a cylindrical holder fixed respectively at both vertical sides of the main body, (6) a conducting ring being fitted around the cylindrical holder and having a projecting sidewise conductor resting on a fastening projection on the inside surface of the cylindrical holder, (7) an L-shaped conductor being fixed on the inside surface of the side wall where the cylindrical holder is fixed on by means of a projection group and holes, having its bended section protruding out the rear surface of the main body and serving as an electrical conducting line together with the conducting ring, and (8) a fastening cap having a groove in its body to be fitted in by the fastening projection of the cylindrical holder such that when the fastening cap is fitted through the conducting ring and in the interior hollow in the cylindrical holder, the fastening cap and the conducting ring may not loosen to fall off; one or two auxiliary bodies being connected with one or both sides of the main body, and having (1) a rectangular plate, (2) a glass groove at the bottom edge of the plate, (3) a supplementary plate extending down from the glass groove, (4) one or two projection groups at one or both sides of the supplementary plate for connecting the auxiliary body bodies with the wing plate(s) of the main body; ventilating means to be mounted on the L-shaped conductor in the main body having (1) a fan, (2) a motor, (3) a base for mounting the fan and the motor and (4) a housing to shield the fan, the motor and the base, said base having projection at both lengthwise sides to fit in grooves at both lengthwise side bottoms of the housing for assembling or disassembling the base and the housing with screws, said base having a notch at each of both lengthwise bottom sides and two conductors on the wall near the notches, said housing having a cylindrical holder respectively at both sides, a conducting ring fitting around the holder, said ring having a projecting conductor to rest on a fastening projection in the holder which is fitted in its interior hollow by a fastening cap fixing the conducting ring, said fastening cap having a groove to fit with the fastening projection in the holder so as to hold tightly the conducting ring and the cap on the holder, and a socket being provided on the base near the motor and connected in parallel with the motor and the conductors or the conducting rings for electricity to be led to the motor; a solar-energy board having (1) a C-shaped clamp respectively extending forward from the both ends of the front edge to catch hold of the holders of the main body or of the ventilating means, (2) a conductor abutting the clamp having a contact point at one end and connected with one pole of the solar-energy board so as to transmit the electricity generated by the solar-energy board to the motor through the conductors, the contact points, and the conducting rings in the main body or in the ventilating means, and a socket at proper place connected with the conductors; characteristics that more than two main bodies can be installed in windows with movable glass in the right and left car doors, and one or two ventilating means can be mounted on the main bodies to suck in the open air by one of them and to exhaust out the air in the car by the other so that the hot stale air in the car can be quickly and effectively exhausted out without causing air convection in the car. 2. The automatic solar-powered car ventilator as claimed in claim 1, wherein the C-shaped clamps of the solar-energy board can movably catch hold of the cylindrical holders of the main body or the ventilating means so that the solar-energy board can be adjusted in its inclination against the sunlight to aquire the best result. 3. The automatic solar-powered car ventilator as claimed in claim 1, wherein the caps in the ventilating means have a central hole for a plug to pass through to fit in the socket.
