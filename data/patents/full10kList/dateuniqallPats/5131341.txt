A system for producing and distributing electric power on a sailing ship, using arrays of photovoltaic cells covering the ships sails and rigging to generate electric power during daylight for the purpose of driving a ships screw. The solar array electric power output is processed by a voltage regulator which charges a large capacity storage battery and energizes an electric motor to drive the ships screw. An AC inverter is also provided to convert the DC power for the AC loads. To increase the area normally available on sailing ships for solar arrays, wing-booms which extend the lengths of the yards, and rolling booms above the yards are proposed for addition to the ships superstructure. The invention should make it possible for sailing ships to resume transportation of cargo without the need for auxiliary gas or oil-burning engines and a fuel supply.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for generating and distributing electric power on a sailing ship having sails supported by masts and yards, comprising: a multiplicity of solar photovoltaic cell arrays; a DC voltage regulator connected to electrical power output terminals of said solar arrays; a storage battery connected to electrical power output terminals of said DC voltage regulator; and an AC inverter connected to electrical power output terminals of said DC voltage regulator; said multiplicity of solar arrays including sail arrays mounted on both sides of the ships sails, beaded rope rigging arrays strung between the ships masts and yards, and deck arrays; said multiplicity of solar arrays having a total area covered with solar photovoltaic cells sufficient to generate DC electrical power when illuminated, for fully charging said storage battery over a period of time, for driving a DC electric motor, and for supplying AC loads on the ship said voltage regulator acting to regulate the varying DC input voltage from said solar arrays to a level suitable for charging said storage battery and for supplying electrical DC loads on the ship; said storage battery being sized for a capacity large enough to supply and operate an electric motor capable of driving a ship's screw as required; said AC inverter being sized and rated sufficient to supply electrical AC loads on the ship. 2. A system as in claim 1 wherein: said solar cell sail arrays comprise a multiplicity of thin-film photovoltaic cells which are electrically connected in series-parallel to form modules; said photovoltaic cells fixedly attached to the ships sails, on both sides of sail, back-to-back; said modules being electrically connected in series to form strings generating high DC voltage power, each said module having a bypass diode connected in parallel with it to protect against shadowing or open circuit; said strings each including series blocking diodes to block reverse power flow; said strings being electrically connected in parallel to form solar arrays. 3. A system as in claim 1 wherein: said beaded rope rigging arrays each comprise three or more lengths of rope; said lengths of rope being covered with beads over a length extending at least the distance between ships masts and yards; said beads each having a multiplicity of thin-film photovoltaic cells covering its outer surface and electrically connected in series parallel to form a module; each said bead having a bypass diode connected in parallel to protect against shadowing or open circuit; each said bead being electrically connected to the next bead for the purpose of generating high voltage DC power. 4. Attachments to a sailing ship's superstructure for increasing the area available for supporting photovoltaic arrays; said attachments comprising: a wing-boom for extending the length of a sailing ships yards to accommodate solar cell beaded rope arrays; and an upper roller boom for attachment to the ships yards to accommodate solar cell beaded rope arrays; said wing-boom comprising a lightweight I-beam section at least 10 feet in length, a hinge fastened to one end of said I-beam section, a means for fastening and storing reefed rope arrays, and eyebolts attached to the distal end of said I-beam section, away from said hinge; said hinge being sized to bolt on to the end of a sailing ships yard, allowing said wing-boom to be pivoted downwards with respect to said yard; said hinge incorporating a metal portion which fits under the end of said yard, projecting below it and acting as a stop for said wing-boom, preventing downward rotation movement beyond the vertical; said means for fastening and storing reefed rope arrays including a rod which is rotated by a motor and supported by two or more supports fixedly attached to said I-beam section along its length; said rod having provision along its length for tying the ends of said beaded rope arrays to enable rolling up the arrays; said wing-boom also able to be used as a ships stern boom, and connected to the stern of a ship for extending the area of support for solar cell beaded rope arrays; said upper roller comprising a wooden boom of a length equal to the ships yards, each roller being located held above and parallel to a yard by a support which is attached to said yard; said upper roller being able to rotate on its longitudinal axis when driven by a motor or rotary device; said upper roller providing a means for fastening and reefing said solar cell beaded rope arrays.
