A solar collector adapted to be conveniently installed on a roof or similar structure includes a casing having a continuous bottom flange adapted to be secured to the roof and providing flashing for suitable roofing material. A continuous side wall extends upwardly from the flange and a continuous shoulder along the side wall and extends outwardly from a lower portion of the side wall to an upper portion thereof. A solar collector heat pan includes a generally flat heat plate having an upper face carrying typical tubing for a liquid to be heated by solar energy, the pan further having a continuous depending flange positioned on the casing shoulder with the plate substantially flush with the top edge of the casing. A light transmitting cover overlies the heat pan and has a continuous depending flange extending above the heat plate so that solar energy may engage the heat plate during relatively early and late daylight hours. The casing side wall is preferably solid and the cover flange extends about the upper portion of the side wall so that wind and foreign matter such as dust and precipitation are effectively prevented from entering below the heat pan within the cover.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar collector comprising, a casing positioning a solar collector heat pan at a desired inclination for receiving solar energy, said casing having a substantially continuous side wall with an upper edge portion, said casing having first means for mounting said wall on a support, and said casing having shoulder means at and extending along said upper edge portion and supporting the heat pan facing upwardly within said casing, said wall including an upper portion extending upwardly from said shoulder means to an upper edge of said edge portion, said heat pan including a heat plate substantially flush with said edge, and a solar energy transmitting cover overlying said upper edge portion and mounted on said casing, said cover including a substantially continuous depending solar energy transmitting flange extending upwardly from said edge and said heat plate for passage of solar energy through the last said flange, and the last said flange having a lower portion encircling said upper portion of said wall for effectively preventing entry of wind or foreign matter within the cover. 2. A solar collector as set forth in claim 1 in which said side wall is substantially solid for effectively preventing ingress of wind, and precipitation and other foreign matter below said heat pan. 3. A solar collector in combination with said mounting as set forth in claim 2 and including said heat pan and in which said first means comprises a substantially continuous flange along the bottom of said side wall and extending outwardly therefrom and providing flashing about said side wall and further providing means for securing said casing to a roof, said second means comprises a substantially continuous shoulder integral with said side wall and extending outwardly from the side wall to said upper portion of said side wall, said heat pan includes a substantially continuous flange depending from said heat plate and received on said shoulder, and said cover includes a substantially continuous, depending, solar energy transmitting flange extending above said heat plate and encircling said upper portion of said side wall and effectively preventing ingress of wind, precipitation and other foreign matter within said cover while permitting passage of solar energy through the last said flange to said heat plate during relatively early and late daylight hours.
