A self-contained, unitary device for collecting and interpreting data reflecting the effect of a force acting on a structure includes a housing adapted to be attached at spaced points to the surface of the structure, an optical sensor within the housing for detecting the relative orientation of spaced surface coordinate vectors of the structure, circuitry within the housing for converting signals from the optical sensor to a form usable by signal-processing electronics also located within the housing. The output of this structural information detector embodies useful information which directly indicates the effect of the force acting on the structure.
Claims Having described our invention in such terms as to enable those skilled in the art to understand and practice it, we claim: 1. A structural information detector for collecting and interpreting data reflecting the effect of at least one of a plurality of forces acting on a structure, said structural information detector comprising, in combination: (a) a housing adapted to be attached to the surface of said structure; (b) optical means within said housing for (i) detecting the relative orientation of spaced surface coordinate vectors of said structure, and (ii) generating primary signals in response to changes in said orientation; (c) circuit means within said housing for converting said primary signals to a form usable by signal-processing electronics; and (d) signal-processing electronics means within said housing, including computational software, for processing said converted primary signals to secondary signals, which embody useful information which directly indicates the effect of at least one of a plurality of forces acting on said structure. 2. Structural information detector of claim 1, in which said optical means, said circuit means and said signal-processing electronics means are carried by a single-piece semiconductor substrate received within said housing. 3. Structural information detector of claim 1, in which said housing comprises first and second housing sub-assemblies: (a) said first housing sub-assembly containing said circuit means, said signal-processing electronics means and those components of said optical means which include (i) a light source, (ii) a plurality of photovoltaic detectors, and (iii) a collimating lens, said light source and photovoltaic detectors being carried on the inner face of a hollow barrel portion formed in said first housing sub-assembly and said collimating lens being carried proximate the open end of said barrel portion; (b) said second housing sub-assembly containing, as another component of said optical means, a plane surface mirror carried on the inner end of a mating barrel portion formed therein, said mating barrel portion being shaped and dimensioned to receive the barrel portion formed in said first housing sub-assembly with an interference fit therebetween to form a unitary structurally integrated device; and (c) means for mounting said first and second housing sub-assemblies at spaced points on a structure. 4. An optical sensor adapted for use in the structural information detector of claim 1 comprising: (a) an elongate light-transmission member formed of a light-transmitting flexible material and having (i) a light-transmitting/receiving end, and (ii) a reflecting end; (b) a concentrating lens fromed in the reflecting end of said member; (c) a light source carried by said light-transmitting/receiving end of said member positioned to direct light through said member toward said reflecting end; (d) light-receiving means carried by said light-transmitting/receiving end of said member for (i) receiving light transmitted through said member from said light source to said concentrating lens and reflected thereby through said member to said light-receiving means, and (ii) generating electrical signals in response to said received light; and (e) means for interconnecting said ends of said member to spaced points on a structure such that bending of said structure causes corresponding bending of said light-transmission member and, in turn, causes a variation in the amount of light received by said light-receiving means.
