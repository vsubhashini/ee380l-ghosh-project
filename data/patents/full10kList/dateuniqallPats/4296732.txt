In a solar radiation collector composed of a mat formed of a black foil member and a radiation pervious foil member, the two members being joined together along the outer edges of the mat and at interior locations of the mat to form an extended flow path and an inlet and outlet for a fluid heat carrier medium, the collector further including a cover connected to the mat along opposed edges thereof and arranged to be disposed in the path of solar radiation toward the mat with an air space being defined between the mat and the cover, with the cover being formed to define a flexible support for holding at least one radiation pervious pane and at least one reflecting panel in relative positions such that the pane, the panel and the mat constitute the legs of a triangle enclosing the air space.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a solar radiation collector composed of a mat formed of a black foil member and a radiation pervious foil member, the two members being joined together along the outer edges of the mat and at interior locations of the mat to form an extended flow path and an inlet and outlet for a fluid heat carrier medium, the collector further including cover means connected to the mat along opposed edges thereof and arranged to be disposed in the path of solar radiation toward the mat with an air space being defined between the mat and the cover means, the improvement wherein said cover means includes flexible mounting means formed adjacent opposed edges thereof for holding at least one radiation pervious pane and at least one reflecting panel, and said flexible mounting means and said mat are dimensioned such that, when such pane and panel are held by said flexible mounting means and said mat is filled with such carrier medium, said flexible mounting means holds the pane and panel in relative positions such that the pane, the panel and said mat constitute the legs of a triangle enclosing the air space. 2. An arrangement as defined in claim 1 wherein said members are joined together at interior locations of said mat along connection lines parallel to said opposed edges of said mat at which said cover means are connected, to form parallel flow channels defining portions of said flow path and extending parallel to said opposed edges. 3. An arrangement as defined in claim 2 wherein said flexible mounting means is arranged to removably hold at least one of the pane and the reflector plate. 4. An arrangement as defined in claim 2 or 3 wherein the dimension of said cover means beween said opposed edges, when said cover means is in a flattened state, is equal to the corresponding dimension of said mat, when said mat is free of carrier medium and is in a flattened state, so that when said corresponding dimension of said mat is decreased due to filling of said mat with carrier medium, a pane and reflector plate held by said cover means pivot upwardly to form the triangular configuration.
