A pedestrian trail signaling device for warning users of the trail or path when an emergency vehicle is approaching the intersection. Emergency vehicles 14 have an actuatable transceiver that transmits a signal to the trail posted signaling device causing warning lights to flash and generation of a response signal informing the emergency vehicle operator that the trail posted signaling device has received the emergency vehicle transmission. A user transmitter having an on/off switch that broadcasts a signal to the trail signaling device causing the signaling device blinking yellow LED displays to blink A passive detector is provided whereby an emergency vehicle strobe light can trigger both flashing warning signals when the passive detector(s) is triggered. A motion detector 44 located on the trail user 16 warning light whereby either or both systems will flash their respective predetermined warning signals when the motion detector(s) is triggered.
Claims I claim: 1. A method for a warning system for use at an intersection of a pedestrian trail and a vehicle roadway, comprising the steps of: a) providing an emergency vehicle having a first transceiver disposed therein wherein the first transceiver transmits a first signal; and, b) providing a trail crossing indicator having a second transceiver disposed therein wherein the second transceiver receives the first signal and in response thereto activates a pair of warning lights visible to users of both the pedestrian trail and the vehicle roadway, and, transmits a second signal back to the first transceiver thereby acknowledging to the first transceiver and the operator of the emergency vehicle receipt of the first signal by the second transceiver; c) providing a trail user having a transmitter thereon wherein the transmitter transmits a third signal to the second transceiver; and, d) wherein the second transceiver receives the third signal and in response thereto activates a pair of warning lights visible to users of both the pedestrian trail and the vehicle roadway, and, transmits a fourth signal to the first transceiver thereby indicating to the first transceiver and the operator of the emergency vehicle that a trail user is nearby; e) providing an on/off control for the first transceiver which is controlled by the operator of the emergency vehicle; f) providing a visual indication to the operator of the emergency vehicle that the second transceiver disposed in the trail crossing indicator has transmitted the second signal back to the emergency vehicle; g) providing an audible indication to the operator of the emergency vehicle that the second transceiver disposed in the trail crossing indicator has transmitted the second signal hack to the emergency vehicle; h) providing an on/off control for the second transceiver which is controlled by the second transceiver; i) having the trail crossing indicator flesh a yellow warning light to the vehicle roadway and a red warning light to the pedestrian trail; j) providing a battery power supply to the trail crossing indicator for providing power to the second transceiver and warning lights; k) providing a solar panel on the trail crossing indicator for providing power to the battery power supply; l) providing an on/off control for the transmitter which is controlled by the trail user; m) providing a visual indication to the trail user that the transmitter is transmitting the third signal; and n) mounting a passive detector on the trail crossing indicator that activates the red warning light when an emergency vehicle equipped with a strobe light passive detection system is nearby, thereby warning a trail user that an emergency vehicle is approaching the intersection. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps of mounting a motion detector on the trail crossing indicator that activates the yellow warning light when a trail user is nearby, thereby warning an operator of the emergency vehicle that a trail user is approaching the intersection.
