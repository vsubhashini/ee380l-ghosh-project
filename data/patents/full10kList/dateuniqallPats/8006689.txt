The assembly according to claim 1 wherein the reflective elements are configured in a ring or oval shape. 6. The assembly according to claim 1 wherein the reflective surface of each reflective element has a relatively shallow concave shape for reflecting incident energy waves towards the focal zone. 7. The assembly according to claim 1 wherein the reflective elements are fabricated from a metallic sheet material having a relatively high reflective index. 8. The assembly according to claim 7 wherein the reflective elements are cuttings from a sheeting of the metallic material. 9. The assembly according to claim 1 wherein the first holding member has an aperture for receiving a fixing member and the second holding member has a slot through which the fixing member extends, the slot being configured to allow the second holding member to be adjustably positioned to engage the adjacent reflective element, and said fixing member is arranged to fix the engagement device to a corresponding support arm or mounting strip. 10. The assembly according to claim 1 wherein the support structure further includes an orientation arrangement for mounting each said reflective element at said orientation, and said orientation arrangement includes paired mounting elements arranged to mount each reflective element at said orientation. 11. The assembly according to claim 10 wherein each said mounting strip has spaced vertical slots arranged to receive said mounting elements 12. The assembly according to claim 10 wherein the paired mounting elements are in the form of paired circular rings associated with said support arms or said mounting strips, and dimensioned to mount each reflective element at said orientation. 13. A solar concentrator comprising the reflector assembly as claimed in claim 1 and an energy collector for receiving and converting the reflected light into another form of energy. 14. The concentrator according to claim 13 wherein the collector is arranged at said focal zone at which it receives the reflected light from the reflective elements; or below said focal zone and a secondary mirror arranged at said focal zone to redirect the reflected light towards the collector. 15. The concentrator according to claim 14 wherein the collector is located in a remote location and a conveying arrangement being provided to convey said reflected energy to the collector. 16. A reflector assembly for an energy concentrator comprising a support structure having a plurality of support arms, and a reflective arrangement having an array of concentric annular reflective elements spacedly arranged on the support arms or on elongate mounting strips fixed to each or selected supported arms, each said reflective element having a reflective surface shaped to reflect incident energy waves, and a holding arrangement arranged to hold the reflective elements in an orientation to direct the reflected energy waves thereof in a direction towards a focal zone of the reflective arrangement, each said reflective element being formed with a curved surface configured to reflect the incident energy waves towards the focal zone and each said holding device having a first end arranged for connection to each said support arm or mounting strip and a second end arranged to engage each reflective element to thereby hold the engaged reflective element in position, each said support arm or mounting strip having a substantially saw tooth shaped upper edge with angled edge portions for mounting the reflective elements. 17. The assembly according to claim 16 wherein each reflective element has an inner edge and an outer edge, and said second end is hook shaped and arranged to engage said inner or outer edge of each reflective element. 18. The assembly according to claim 17 wherein each said mounting strip has spaced retention notches arranged to receive said inner or outer edges of the reflective elements. 19. The assembly according to claim 16 wherein each holding device has a lower edge for engagement with each reflective element and the lower edge is shaped to cooperate with said support arm or mounting strip to form said curved surface of the reflective elements. 20.
