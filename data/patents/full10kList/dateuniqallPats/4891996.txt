A cylindrical yoke 3 of a d.c. motor of an engine starter having a planet reduction gear mechanism and a bracket 5 fitted on an extension of the yoke without relative rotation therebetween is formed integrally on an inner surface of the extension with internal gear teeth 4 of the planet reduction gear mechanism, which mesh with a solar gear 6 formed integrally on an armature shaft 2 of the motor through planet gears 7 supported by a flange 10 of an output shaft 11 of the starter. The motor is separated from the planet reduction gear mechanism by a flange 3b, 22 arranged therebetween and supporting a bearing 16 which supports the armature shaft.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An engine starter for an internal combustion engine, comprising: a planet reduction gear mechanism including a solar gear (6), a plurality of planet gears (7), and an internal gear member (4), and a d.c. motor including a cylindrical yoke (3) having an axial extension formed integrally and in one piece therewith, said extension defining a housing surrounding the planet reduction gear mechanism and having a toothed inner circumferential surface defining the internal gear member, an armature (1) fixedly secured to a rotary shaft (2) of said motor defining said solar gear at one end thereof, and magnet means (15) disposed between said armature and said yoke, said axial yoke extension being non-rotatably fitted to a mounting bracket (5), said internal gear member meshing with said planet gears, which in turn mesh with said solar gear, said planet gears being supported by a flange portion (10) of an output shaft (11), and flange means (3b; 22) disposed between said yoke and said axial extension and extending radially inwardly therefrom for providing a partition therebetween, said flange means being formed with a center hole for supporting a bearing (16), and said rotary shaft of said motor being rotatably supported by said bearing, wherein said flange means is formed integrally and in one piece with an inner surface of said cylindrical yoke, wherein a root diameter circle of the toothed inner circumferential surface of the axial extension is substantially co-cylindrical with an inner circumferential surface of said yoke. 2. An engine starter for an internal combustion engine, comprising: a planet reduction gear mechanism including a solar gear (6), a plurality of planet gears (7), and an internal gear member (4), and a d.c. motor including a cylindrical yoke (3) having an axial extension formed integrally and in one piece therewith, said extension defining a housing surrounding the planet reduction gear mechanism and having a toothed inner circumferential surface defining the internal gear member, an armature (1) fixedly secured to a rotary shaft (2) of said motor defining said solar gear at one end thereof, and magnet means (15) disposed between said armature and said yoke, said axial yoke extension being non-rotatably fitted to a mounting bracket (5), said internal gear member meshing with said planet gears, which in turn mesh with said solar gear, said planet gears being supported by a flange portion (10) of an output shaft (11), and flange means (3b) disposed between said yoke and said axial extension and extending radially inwardly therefrom for providing a partition therebetween, said flange means being formed with a center hole for supporting a bearing (16), and said rotary shaft of said motor being rotatably supported by said bearing, wherein said flange means is a discrete annular disc and said axial extension is enlarged in diameter to form a stepped portion between said cylindrical yoke and said extension, said discrete annular disc being assembled to a radially inward surface of said stepped portion which is perpendicular to an axis of said rotary shaft. 3. The engine starter as claimed in claims 1 or 2, wherein said extension of said yoke is faucet fitted to said bracket. 4. The engine starter as claimed in claim 3, wherein a faucet fitting surface of said extension includes at least one flat plane and a faucet fitting surface of said bracket includes a corresponding flat plane, said flat plane of said extension and said bracket being adaped to prevent the relative rotation therebetween when faucet fitted.
