An open-space battery housing portion 9a is integrally formed in a portion of a connecting mechanism 11 of a device main body 1 to house a secondary battery 6 between a main circuit substrate 3 and a connecting plate 22 when the connecting plate 22 is coupled with the connecting mechanism 11, in which the connecting plate 22 also serves as a cover member for the battery housing portion 9a, whereby the secondary battery 6 can be removed from the battery housing portion 9a when the connecting plate 22 is uncoupled from the connecting mechanism 11.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A vehicular microwave detector, comprising: a device main body having a flat case structure; a connecting mechanism integrally formed in the underside surface of the device main body; a mounting bracket which is adapted to be removably coupled with the bottom of the device main body, the mounting bracket including a base plate which is adapted to be fixed to a prescribed position inside an automobile, a connecting plate which is adapted to be removably coupled with the connecting mechanism of the device main body, and a linking mechanism which links the connecting plate with the base plate; a main circuit substrate provided inside the device main body; a horn antenna mounted on the main circuit substrate so that the opening of the horn antenna faces one side of the case of the device main body; a power source including a solar cell panel provided on the top of the device main body case so as to be exposed to outside light, and a secondary battery which is charged by the solar cell panel; and a battery housing portion adapted for housing the secondary battery, the battery housing portion protruding below the bottom surface of the device main body and having an open lower end, wherein the connecting mechanism is provided below the battery housing portion so that when the connecting plate is coupled with the connecting mechanism, the connecting plate also serves as a cover member to cover the battery housing portion, whereby the battery housing portion is exposed to enable the secondary battery to be removed or installed when the connecting plate is uncoupled from the connecting mechanism. 2. A vehicular microwave detector, comprising: a device main body having a flat case structure; a connecting mechanism integrally formed in the underside surface of the device main body; a mounting bracket which is adapted to be removably coupled with the bottom of the device main body, the mounting bracket including a base plate which is adapted to be fixed to a prescribed position inside an automobile, a connecting plate which is adapted to be removably coupled with the connecting mechanism of the device main body, and a linking mechanism which links the connecting plate with the base plate; a main circuit substrate provided inside the device main body along the bottom surface of the case; a horn antenna mounted on the main circuit substrate so that the opening of the horn antenna faces one side of the case of the device main body; a power source including a solar cell panel provided along the top of the device main body case so as to be exposed to outside light, and a secondary battery which is charged by the solar cell panel; and a battery housing portion adapted for housing the secondary battery, the battery housing portion being integrally formed in a portion of the connecting mechanism of the device main body so as to be arranged between the main circuit substrate and the connecting plate when the connecting plate is coupled with the connecting mechanism, wherein the connecting plate also serves as a cover member to cover the battery housing portion when the connecting plate is coupled with the connecting mechanism, whereby the battery housing portion is exposed to enable the secondary battery to be removed or installed when the connecting plate is uncoupled from the connecting mechanism. 3. A vehicular microwave detector, comprising: a device main body having a flat case structure; a connecting mechanism integrally formed in the underside surface of the device main body; a mounting bracket which is adapted to be removably coupled with the bottom of the device main body, the mounting bracket including a base plate which is adapted to be fixed to a prescribed position inside an automobile, a connecting plate which is adapted to be removably coupled with the connecting mechanism of the device main body, and a linking mechanism which links the connecting plate with the base plate; a main circuit substrate provided inside the device main body; a horn antenna mounted on the main circuit substrate so that the opening of the horn antenna faces one side of the case of the device main body; a power source including a solar cell panel provided on the top of the device main body case so as to be exposed to outside light, and a secondary battery which is charged by the solar cell panel; and a battery housing portion adapted for housing the secondary battery, the battery housing portion being an open space integrally formed in the connecting plate so as to have an opening which faces a portion of the connecting mechanism when the connecting plate is coupled with the connecting mechanism, wherein the connecting mechanism also serves as a cover member to cover the battery housing portion when the connecting plate is coupled with the connecting mechanism, whereby the battery housing portion is exposed to enable the secondary battery to be removed or installed when the connecting plate is uncoupled from the connecting mechanism. 4. The vehicular microwave detector of claim 3, wherein the coupling of the connecting mechanism and the connecting plate establishes an electrical connection, whereby the secondary battery is electrically connected to the circuit of the device main body when the connecting mechanism and connecting plate are in a coupled state.
