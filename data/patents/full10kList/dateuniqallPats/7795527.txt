A solar cell module includes photoelectric converters, and resin surface covering materials covering the light-incident side of photoelectric converters, trenches being formed in the surface covering materials. The trenches extend approximately in parallel to the horizontal plane for a certain length, and in parallel to each other, so as to facilitate, in repairing the damage therein, improving the adhesiveness between the module surface and the bonding portion of a repair material so as to prevent water and contamination from getting into the bonding portion, prevent the solar cell module properties from deteriorating, prevent any ground fault through the water, and prevent the repair material from peeling.
