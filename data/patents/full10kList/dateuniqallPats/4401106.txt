A home heating system for supplying heated air and water is made up of a solar energy heating unit. The solar energy heating unit is provided with a channel in an insulating layer mounted within the housing, which channel directs heated air to the interior of the home. The interior of the housing also is provided with a plurality of water pipes for heating water. The water is preferably supplied from an indoor swimming pool and redirected back to the indoor swimming pool after being heated. A fireplace is also provided in conjunction with the solar energy heating unit, which fireplace acts as a back-up unit when the solar unit is not operable due to insufficient sunlight. The fireplace contains a conventional hearth and flue and is provided with a plurality of air conduits and water pipes within the flue so that the air and water may be heated by the fire in the hearth.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar energy heating unit comprising, in combination, a V-shaped housing made of clear material, said V-shaped housing having a first side panel and a second side panel, and a base portion connecting first ends of said first and second side panels; an insulating layer means positioned within said housing perpendicular to said base portion extending from said base portion toward the vertex of said housing, said insulating layer extending along most of the length of said housing; a reflecting layer means adjacent to said insulating layer means for reflecting light rays from the sun; water pipe means within said housing, said water pipe means being heated by the ambient air within the housing to thereby heat the water therein, wherein said insulating layer means comprises a channel formed midway along the length thereof and extending downwardly in a direction from said vertex of said housing toward said base portion, said channel serving as an air duct for directing heated air downwardly to a room of a house, wherein said reflecting layer means is in abutting relationship to said insulating layer means and attached thereto, said reflecting layer means covering said channel along the length of said channel, said reflecting layer means extending upwardly beyond said channel toward said vertex and said insulating layer means having an upper portion thereof of reduced width and which is affixed to near said vertex, said reduced portion of said insulating layer means and the portion of said reflecting layer means defining therebetween a space for directing heated air into said channel. 2. The solar energy heating unit according to claim 1, further comprising another layer of reflecting material, said another layer being mounted to said insulating layer means on the other side thereof to which said reflecting layer means is mounted; said insulating layer means having another channel formed therein on the side thereof remote from the side in which is formed said channel; and an additional pipe means positioned adjacent to said another reflecting layer. 3. A home heating system comprising, in combination, a solar energy heating means for mounting upon a house; first means for connecting said solar energy heating means to the interior of the house for supplying warm air thereto; second means connected to said solar energy heating means and connected to a source of water for heating the water, wherein said solar energy heating means comprises a housing of clear material for allowing the sun's rays to pass therethrough, an insulating layer mounted within said housing, a reflecting layer attached to said insulating layer for reflecting the sun's rays, water pipe means for passage therethrough of water, said water pipe means being positioned in front of said reflecting layer, wherein said housing has a V-shaped cross-section and comprises a first side panel, a second side panel, and a base portion connecting the first end of said first and second side panels, the second end faces of said first and second side panels being connected together to form the vertex of said V-shaped housing, wherein said insulating layer is mounted transverse of said base portion and extends upwardly therefrom toward said vertex of said housing, said reflecting layer running coplanar with and parallel to said insulating layer, wherein said insulating layer comprises an air duct extending along the width thereof in a direction transverse to said base portion, said first connecting means having a first end in fluid communication with said air duct for directing heated air to the interior of the house, wherein said reflecting layer overlays said insulating layer along the entire length of said air duct, and said water pipe means comprises a plurality of pipes extending in the direction transverse to the direction of said air duct; said second connecting means comprising a first conduit means having a first end in fluid communication with the source of water to be heated and a second end in fluid communication with a first inlet end of said plurality of pipes, and a second conduit means having a first end in fluid communication with the source of water and a second end in fluid communication with the second outlet end of said plurality of pipes, said first conduit means supplying water to said plurality of pipes from said source of water, and said second conduit means returning the heated water for said second outlet end of said plurality of pipes to the source of water to supply heated water. 4. The home heating system according to claim 3, wherein said first conduit means comprises a pump for supplying the water from the source of water to the first inlet end of said plurality of pipes. 5. The home heating system according to claim 3, wherein said first connecting means comprises a first end in fluid communication with the lower end of said air duct, and a second end in fluid communication with the interior of the home.
