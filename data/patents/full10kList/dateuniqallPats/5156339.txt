A lounge chair utilizes a first "U" shaped frame pivotally mounting a second "U" shaped frame, with the first "U" shaped frame including a plurality of legs for positioning the first "U" shaped frame relative to an underlying surface, with each frame including a plurality of sprinkling water ports direction therethrough, wherein the second frame includes a hose connection to permit fluid communication to a fluid conduit utilizing a valve member interposed therebetween to control fluid flow. A modification of the invention includes directional conduits mounted to each "U" shaped frame to permit directional orientation of the port flow as required. Solar reflective slats are directed within the first and second "U" shaped frame.
Claims What is claimed as being new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent of the United States is as follows: 1. A water sprinkler lounge chair apparatus, comprising, a "U" shaped first conduit frame and a "U" shaped second conduit frame, the first frame including parallel first frame right and left legs, with the second frame including parallel second frame right and left legs, wherein a right hollow pivot hinge effects fluid communication between the first frame right leg and the second frame right leg, and a left hollow pivot hinge in fluid communication and pivotally mounting the first frame left leg and the second frame left leg, and a fluid valve mounted to the first frame, with the fluid valve including a fluid conduit secured therethrough to direct fluid flow into the first frame and the second frame, and the first frame right and left legs including a plurality of parallel flexible solar reflective slats orthogonally directed between the first frame right and left legs, and the second frame right and left legs including a further plurality of spaced flexible solar reflective slats directed orthogonally between the second frame right and left legs, and the first frame including a plurality of first outlet spray ports, and the second frame including a plurality of second outlet spray ports to direct fluid flow through the spray ports from the fluid conduit, and each of the first and second outlet spray ports includes an internally threaded wall and a plurality of directional conduits, each directional conduit including an externally threaded coupling tube arranged for securement into said internally threaded wall of each spray port, and each coupling tube including an accordion pleated conduit member mounted to an upper terminal end of each coupling tube, and each conduit member in fluid communication with at least one conical nozzle, and each conduit member includes a conduit junction, and each conduit junction includes a predetermined number of secondary conduits, each secondary conduit including an accordion pleated construction and each secondary conduit including said at least one conical nozzle mounted thereto, and a spray head, the spray head including a rear wall and a front wall, the rear wall including a plurality of conical cavities equal in number to the predetermined number of secondary conduits, and each conical cavity complementarily receiving one of said conical nozzles therewithin, and the front wall of the spray head including an apertured plate coextensive therewith, wherein the apertured plate is in fluid communication with the conical cavities to direct fluid flow through the apertured plate from the conical cavities directed through the rear wall of the spray head.
