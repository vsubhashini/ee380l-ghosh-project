This disclosure relates to a solar heater apparatus for a swimming pool which incorporates a submersible suspendible black body sheet to serve as a device to absorb solar radiation and transfer the collected energy to the pool water so that the pool water can be efficiently heated.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of passively heating the water in a swimming pool comprising the steps of: winding a sequence of individual strips of heat-absorbing material unto a mandrel; reeling out a first strip of heat-absorbing material; securing the first end portion of the strip reeled out to the far side of the pool; removing the first unwound strip from the mandrel; attaching the opposite end of the first strip to the near end of the pool; suspending the first strip between opposite ends of the pool with a substantial portion thereof disposed in the water; sinking the disposed portion of the strip of heat-absorbing material due to the holes therein; reeling out a second strip of heat-absorbing material; continuing said steps of securing, removing, attaching, suspending, sinking, and reeling out until a sufficient number of individual strips of heat-absorbing material have been suspended and sunk to substantially cover the pool or enough of the pool for generating the desired quantity of heat; exposing the suspended, sunken strips of heat-absorbing material to solar radiation; absorbing heat from said solar radiation; dispersing the heat collected by the strips of heat-absorbing material by natural convection within the pool; further spreading the heat due to increased convection from the holes in said strips; gradually evenly the raised temperature of the water in the pool until a desired temperature has been reached. 2. The method of claim 1 further comprising the steps of: disconnecting the near end of a first strip of heat-absorbing material; connecting the first strip of heat-absorbing material to the mandrel; releasing the secured portion of the opposite end of the strip at the far end of the pool; reeling in the first strip of heat-absorbing material; rewinding the first strip of heat-absorbing material onto the mandrel; disconnecting the near end of the next strip; continuing the steps of connecting, releasing, reeling in, rewinding, and disconnecting, until all of the individual strips of heat-absorbing material have been retrieved and rewound onto said mandrel. 3. The method of claim 2 further comprising the steps of mounting the mandrel on a mobile frame; anchoring at least a portion of the frame during the reeling and unreeling steps; and moving said frame to a remote location for storing the individual strips wound on the mandrel until needed to reheat the pool. 4. The method of claim 3 further comprising the step of reinforcing at least one of said individual strips of heat-absorbing material with a matrix of interconnecting cords operatively coupled thereto to strengthen the sheet particularly during the reeling and unreeling operations.
