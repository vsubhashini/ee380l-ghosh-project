The present invention provides a photovoltaic module (20) comprising a photovoltaic material and a heat sink in thermal communication with the photovoltaic material proximate a mounting surface of the heat sink. The heat sink comprises a plurality of fins (12) that are movable between a first position parallel to the mounting surface and a second position non-parallel to the mounting surface. Orientation of the fins in the first position may be particularly desirable during fabrication of the module when the heat sink is attached to the photovoltaic material. As such, the present invention provides a method for fabricating a photovoltaic module comprising providing a photovoltaic material and providing the heat sink having movable fins. The fins are oriented in the first position and the heat sink is then attached to the photovoltaic material. After the heat sink is attached, the fins may be unfolded into the second position.
