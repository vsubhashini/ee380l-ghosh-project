A solar electric generating system is provided which directly generates D.C. current from ambient light to charge a rechargeable battery through a blocking diode, and a wiring harness adaptable to connect to the existing internal circuitry of conventional existing navigation bouys. This invention is designed to be used as an add on to convert existing navigation bouys that now use throw-away batteries to more economical rechargeable batteries at a very low cost.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar generating system designed to convert existing navigation buoys using conventional throw-away batteries to more economical rechargeable batteries lasting several years, said invention comprising a flat rectangular stainless steel mounting platform with two solar panels and two flexible antennas mounted on said platform and a hole punched in the center of said platform in the space between said two solar panels and sized to fit over the existing caisson of said buoy and adapted to be secured in place on said existing buoy caisson by means of the existing lens locking nut and security bolt of said caisson, a wiring harness connected to said solar panels mounted on said flat rectangular stainless steel platform adapted to extend through the wall of said buoy caisson and to connect with said rechargeable battery, further including a series connected blocking diode to prevent the battery from discharging during dark periods.
