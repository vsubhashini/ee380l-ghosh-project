A field coil (2) is excited by a solar battery (9) attached on a car to use an alternating current generator as of a separately excited type and a battery (8) is supplementarily charged by the solar battery (9).
Claims We claim: 1. An alternating current generator system for a car, comprising: a field coil; an armature coil having a three-phase connection to generate an alternating current output; a rectifying device for rectifying the alternating current output from said armature coil; a battery to be charged with the output of said rectifying device; a voltage controlling device for turning on and off a field current passing through said field coil; a solar battery; a switch connected between said solar battery and said battery for comparing the voltage from the said solar battery to a threshold value and supplying said field current from said battery when said voltage is below said threshold value and supplying said field current from said solar battery when said voltage is above said threshold value; charging means for charging said battery from said solar battery; wherein said field current is supplied separately from said rectified output when said voltage from said solar battery exceeds said threshold value, so as to produce an increased output; and wherein said battery is charged when the voltage of said solar battery exceeds the voltage of said battery. 2. The alternating current generator system for a car according to claim 1, wherein said solar battery is attached to the bonnet of the car mounting said alternating current generator. 3. The alternating current generator system for a car according to claim 1, wherein said solar battery is attached on the roof of the car mounting said alternating current generator.
