A solar collector for heating a fluid, e.g., air or water, is provided with at least one glass plate and an infrared reflector plate mounted about a solar and infrared energy absorber to provide fluid heating compartments. Facilities are provided for moving the fluid through the heating compartments to efficiently utilize the solar and infrared energy to heat the fluid. Other embodiments of solar collectors are taught for efficiently heating the fluid by increasing the fluid path to optimize the use of solar and infrared energy.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar collector for heating gas by solar energy, comprising: a cover plate capable of passing solar energy; a solar energy absorber having a first surface, and a second opposite surface and a first plurality of holes therein for flowing the gas to be heated away from said first surface and a second plurality of holes for flowing the gas to be heated away from said second surface, said first and second plurality of holes alternated along said absorber; a plate; means for mounting said cover plate in spaced relation to said first absorber surface to provide a plurality of first heating compartments and said plate in spaced relation to said second absorber surface to provide a plurality of second heating compartments; means for preventing uncontrolled movement of ambient air into the said first and second heating compartments; said first plurality of holes directs the flow of gas to be heated into said first heating compartment away from the first surface of said absorber toward said cover plate and said second plurality of holes directs the flow of gas to be heated away from the second surface of the absorber toward said plate; and means for passing the gas to be heated into at least one of said compartments and out of at least one of said compartments wherein the gas to be heated as it passes through said first and second heating compartments is heated by convective heat transfer. 2. The solar collector as set forth in claim 1 wherein said plate is an infrared reflector plate. 3. The solar collector as set forth in claim 1 wherein said cover plate is a first cover plate and further including: a second cover plate capable of passing solar energy; and means for mounting said second cover plate in spaced relation to said first cover plate to provide a moisture-free airspace therebetween.
