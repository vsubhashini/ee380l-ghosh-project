An active solar heating system, adapted for retrofit installation in a building, consists of a solar collector module and a plenum box assembly, the latter including flexible conduits which are connected to the module for actively circulating room air therethrough. The system enables the utilization of solar collector modules that are constructed in standard four by eight dimensions, while accommodating the necessity for misalignment of the room register and the air flow apertures of the module.
Claims Having thus described the invention, what is claimed is: 1. An active solar heating system adapted for retrofit installation in a building, with minimal structural modification thereto, comprising: (1) a solar collector module adapted for mounting upon an outside building wall, including a frame having disposed therein a transparent front panel and a spaced generally parallel rear panel defining an air flow space therebetween, and at least one member dividing said space, in a plane perpendicular to the planes of said front and rear panels, into two chambers, said rear panel having a pair of adjacent apertures formed therethrough near one end of said module, one of said apertures communicating with each of said chambers and said apertures being substantially isolated from one another by said dividing member, said chambers being in air flow communication with one another adjacent the opposite end of said module, thereby establishing a double-pass air flow path between said apertures through said module; and (2) a plenum box assembly for actively circulating room air through said module, said assembly including: (a) a box defining a plenum with an open front side, and adapted for installation in an opening formed through the building wall, with said open side disposed to the interior of the building and lying substantially in the plane of the interior wall surface, said box having an internal barrier member dividing said plenum into two adjacent compartments, and a rear wall with a pair of passages formed therethrough, each communicating with one of said plenum compartments, (b) a pair of flexible conduits connected to said box and said module with one of said conduits providing air flow communication between one of said compartments of said plenum box and one of said chambers of said module through said passages and apertures thereof, respectively, and (c) blower means mounted substantially within one of said conduits for inducing such air flow circulation, whereby said system is readily installed by forming an opening through an outside wall of the building, mounting said module exteriorly thereon and mounting said plenum box within said opening, and establishing air flow communication between said module and said box by connecting said conduits therebetween. 2. The system of claim 1 wherein said solar collector module additionally includes at least one panel for absorption of solar radiation and conversion of such radiation to thermal energy, said absorption panel being substantially planar and being spaced between and in a plane parallel to said front and rear panels of said module, to subdivide said chambers thereof and to define air flow passages on both sides of said absorption panel. 3. The system of claim 1 wherein said solar collector module includes a plurality of said dividing members. 4. The system of claim 1 wherein said panel is about eight feet long and four feet wide. 5. In a method of retrofitting a solar collector module into an existing building structure, to produce an active supplemental heating system, the steps comprising: forming an opening through an outside wall of the building; constructing a mounting framework on the exterior of said outside wall generally about said opening; mounting a solar collector module exteriorly on said wall within said framework; mounting a plenum box within said opening; and establishing air flow communication between said module and said box; said solar collector module including a frame having disposed therein a transparent front panel and a spaced generally parallel rear panel defining an air flow space therebetween, and at least one member dividing said space, in a plane perpendicular to the planes of said front and rear panels, into two chambers, said rear panel having a pair of adjacent apertures formed therethrough near one end of said module, one of said apertures communicating with each of said chambers and said apertures being substantially isolated from one another by said dividing member, said chambers being in air flow communication with one another adjacent the opposite end of said module, thereby establishing a double-pass air flow path between said apertures through said module; and said plenum box assembly including: (a) a box defining a plenum with an open front side, and adapted for installation in an opening formed through the building wall, with said open side disposed to the interior of the building and lying substantially in the plane of the interior wall surface, said box having an internal barrier member dividing said plenum into two adjacent compartments, and a rear wall with a pair of passages formed therethrough, each communicating with one of said plenum compartments, (b) a pair of flexible conduits connected to said box and said module with one of said conduits providing air flow communication between one of said compartments of said plenum box and one of said chambers of said module through said passages and apertures thereof, respectively, and (c) blower means mounted substantially within one of said conduits for inducing such air flow circulation, said air flow communication between said module and said box being established by connecting said conduits therebetween. 6. The method of claim 5 wherein said module and said wall are of substantially the same length, and wherein said box and module are disposed with said apertures and passages thereof, respectively, substantially misaligned.
