The invention contemplates improved apparatus for collecting solar radiation and directionally concentrating the same upon utilization means such as a photovoltaic cell system. In the form described, arrayed collecting devices are mounted for individual tracking of maximum solar-energy response at each such cell system, utilizing time-shared access to a microprocessor, and correctional-drive signals uniquely appropriate to the orientation of each collecting device are supplied by the microprocessor on a time-shared basis for the respective components of orientation correction drive means for each collecting device. Since each collecting device is thus automatically correctively positioned for maximum output of its own utilization device, there is an avoidance of precision requirements (a) as to mounting the several collecting devices with respect to each other and (b) as to basic drives to anticipate relative aspect of the sun, as a function of the time of day, or the day of the year, and whatever the earthbound location of the apparatus.
