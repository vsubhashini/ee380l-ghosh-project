The waste material holding tank located within a portable, outdoor toilet cabana is vented to atmosphere by a vent pipe extending upwardly from the tank to the roof of the toilet cabana. A small, electrical blower fan is mounted upon the upper, open end of the vent pipe for sucking air from the holding tank and blowing the air to outside atmosphere. A solar energy panel is mounted upon the roof of the cabana near the fan and is electrically connected to the fan. The panel generates electrical energy in response to a predetermined level of sunlight for electrically energizing the fan. Thus, the fan circulates air through the holding tank during the items that the sun is shining upon the cabana, to reduce the solar heat build-up in the holding tank for reducing the generation of noxious odors caused by heat induced reactions in the waste material in the tank.
Claims Having fully described one operative embodiment of this invention, we now claim: 1. An outdoor toilet holding tank ventilation system for reducing the generation of noxious odors by solar energy heat build-ups in a toilet waste material holding tank located within a portable, outdoor toilet cabana containing toilet equipment, comprising: a vent pipe having a lower end opening into the toilet waste material holding tank and an opposite upper, open end portion which extends into the cabana; a small, electrical motor-operated, blower fan mounted upon the vent pipe open end operation for blowing air outside of the cabana, the fan being located within the cabana, just beneath the roof of the cabana and opening outwardly of the cabana roof, said fan including a housing fitted upon the open end of the vent pipe and a cover vent extending from said housing out said cabana roof to exhaust to atmosphere, said cover vent including a vent tube extending from said fan housing through the cabana roof a short distance above the roof, a plurality of axial slots are formed in the vent tube for enabling exhaust, and a cap covering said vent tube to protect against entry of rain or the like, said housing and vent cover are easily and readily removable from said vent pipe to enable changing, replacing, or the like, when needed; a solar heat-electrical energy generating panel mounted upon the exterior of the cabana for exposure to natural sunlight, to generate electrical energy in response to direct exposure to predetermined levels of sunlight shining thereupon; said panel being electrically connected to the fan motor for providing electrical energy for activating the fan only during periods of such predetermined levels of sunlight applied to the cabana; whereby the fan sucks air out of the waste holding tank through the vent pipe and blows the air out of the pipe to atmosphere for causing air to circulate through the cabana and through the tank and, thereby, to remove some of the solar energy-caused heat concentrated in said tank and, as a result, reduce heat-caused chemical or bacteriological activity within the waste material in the tank for reducing the generation of noxious odors resulting from such activity. 2. An outdoor toilet holding tank ventilation system as defined in claim 1, and said cabana having a roof with the solar panel being mounted upon the exterior surface of the roof for exposure to sunlight directed against said roof. 3. An outdoor toilet holding tank as defined in claim 2, and said solar panel being mounted upon the cabana roof near the outside vent pipe end and fan and being connected to the fan motor by an electrically conductive conduit located on the roof. 4. An outdoor toilet holding tank ventilation system for reducing the generation of noxious odors by solar energy heat build-ups in a toilet waste material holding tank located within a portable, outdoor toilet cabana containing toilet equipment, comprising: a vent pipe having a lower end opening into the toilet waste material holding tank and an opposite upper, open end portion which extends through the cabana and opens to outside atmosphere; a small, electrical motor-operated, blower fan mounted upon the vent pipe open end portion for blowing air outside of the cabana, the blower fan comprising a small, relatively flat, motor-fan assembly which is generally centered over the outside end of the vent pipe, mounting means securing the motor-fan assembly upon the vent pipe, a cover positioned over, and spaced a short distance above, the motor fan assembly, and secured to the outside end of the vent pipe, with at least portions of the interior of the cover being unobstructed so that air from the fan blows against the inside surface of the cover and is directed downwardly towards and outwardly of the cover for exhausting to atmosphere; a short length vent adaptor tube sized to connect with the upper end portion of the vent pipe, and with the adaptor tube having a radially extending substantially flat flange formed on its upper end, upon which flange the motor fan is mounted in roughly axial alignment with the upper end portion of the vent pipe; a substantially continuous rim formed upon and extending from the peripheral edge of said flange and the cover being secured to said rim, with the flange exterior, peripheral edges being shaped so that selective portions of the flange extend further from the center of the flange than the remaining portions of the flange, so as to provide unobstructed spaces for the passage of air outwardly from the cover around said flange; a solar heat-electrical energy generating panel mounted upon the exterior of the cabana for exposure to natural sunlight, to generate electrical energy in response to direct exposure to predetermined levels of sunlight shining thereupon; said panel being electrically connected to the fan motor for providing electrical energy for activating the fan only during periods of such predetermined levels of sunlight applied to the cabana; whereby the fan sucks air out of the waste holding tank through the vent pipe and blows the air out of the pipe to atmosphere for causing air to circulate through the cabana and through the tank and, thereby, to remove some of the solar energy-caused heat concentrated in said tank and, as a result, reduce heat-caused chemicals or bacteriological activity within the waste material in the tank for reducing the generation of noxious odors resulting from such activity. 5. An outdoor toilet holding tank ventilation system as defined in claim 1, and with the motor fan assembly being located closely adjacent to the cabana roof for blowing air from the holding tank outwardly of the cabana roof. 6. An outdoor toilet holding tank ventilation system as defined in claim 5, and including removable fastening means securing the vent adaptor tube and the vent pipe outside end portion together so that the motor fan assembly, cover and vent adaptor tube form a unit which may be applied to or removed from the vent pipe for maintenance, replacement or removal when not needed.
