An apparatus for the concentration of solar radiation by directing it upon Fresnel zone sections of axially short, electroplated surfaces of spin cast parabolic mirrors. The short focal length optical system is composed of off axis parabolic surfaces of revolution and secondary reflectors. These reflectors concentrate the suns rays to produce heat with which to generate steam, and to melt high temperature salts.
Claims I claim: 1. An apparatus for converting solar radiation into high temperature heat energy wherein the solar radiation is directed downward by means forming reflecting planes onto a stationary array of axially shortened, off axis primary parabolic mirrors arranged such that said downward directed radiation is concentrated upon a flat secondary reflecting means located adjacent to said array and by which the concentrated radiation is directed downward into a stationary radiation to enthalpy exchanger; said reflecting planes being located upon a rotating gantry, said gantry including means to enable said gantry to follow the sun in azimuth and means to pivotally mount said reflecting planes including means to follow the suns radiation in elevation to maintain the angle of incidence of the suns rays vertically upon said stationary array of off axis mirrors. 2. An apparatus as described in claim 1 for concentrating solar radiation into high temperature heat energy wherein said parabolic mirrors consist of stationarily mounted groups of solid surface Fresnel zone mirrors which form said off axis primary parabolic mirror that is shortened axially wherein the suns rays reflected from said primary parabolic mirror surfaces are directed to a flat secondary reflecting means located near said off axis primary parabolic mirror to concentrate said rays upon a stationary radiation to enthalpy exchanger located near means forming the focal point of said primary reflecting means, whereon said off axis primary parabolic mirror is a reflective electroplated material; and wherein said reflecting planes include nearby telescoping heliostat to follow the suns rays in both azimuth and elevation to maintain the suns rays stationary upon said groups of axially shortened Fresnel zone solid surface off axis primary mirrors, and including means to heat water into high pressure steam, and heat molten sodium chloride and molten carbonates, through an inert gas window, and drive gases from limestone rock, and melt sand with intense solar radiation from said stationary off axis primary parabolic mirror surface. 3. An apparatus as described in claim 1 wherein said parabolic solar mirrors consist of optical Fresnel zones which are used to superimpose four sun images into a stationary solar kiln from the off axis primary parabolic mirrors fabricated from a single set of parabolic master hexagons which are spin cast from Cerro alloy, molten aluminum, and epoxy that harden quickly during rotation in a wind shielded form box on a centrifuge, and by pouring melted parafin into each concave parabolic master hexagon, and after cooling each mold, and separating them to get convex master parafin replica castings from each of the spin cast master hexagon molds having the same compound curvature as the original master mold, and coating four identical master parafin replica castings with several layers of silver metal deposited from a fine mist of chemicals and electroplating the convex side of each master parafin replica casting with copper metal, before bonding on a honeycomb cell structure and three adjustment studs using epoxy bonding material to reinforce the very thin copper plated off axis primary mirror and separating these mass produced Fresnel zone parabolic mirrors from their master parafin replica casting and mounting them on the stationary parabolic mirror collection system array. 4. An apparatus as described in claim 1 wherein said stationary off axis primary parabolic mirror is fabricated in contiguous sections that fit together side by side to form a large expanse of mirror that has the outer sections near the rim of the collector set back to a position making a plane with the central mirror sections forming an axially shortened off axis primary replica parabola that is easier to mount on a typical optical Cassegrainian system having Fresnel zone segments of mirror that direct concentrated solar radiation to secondary mirror supports on which a stationary flat secondary reflector is mounted and cooled internally by circulating a solution that is refrigerated to remove excess heat and keep said flat secondary reflector from discoloring its surface and melting. 5. An apparatus as described in claim 3 wherein means is provided to combine several optical ray paths from the sun on a solar collection system by superimposing the concentrated reflections from up to four off axis primary replica parabolas into a stationary solar kiln from separate Fresnel zone hexagons having the same three dimensional compound curvature as corresponding hexagons which are cast from a single spin cast master mold by first casting a rough base parabola inside the hexagonal form box and then spin casting multiple layers of molten aluminum, and in addition spin casting epoxy resin while moving the outer edge of the form box by alternately raising and lowering it. 6. An apparatus as described in claim 3 a parabolic solar collector as described in claim 1 wherein stationary parabolic Fresnel mirrors provide a source of concentrated radiation which produces high pressure steam for stationary power generating plants, and for stripper oil wells, by heating water and generating superheated steam in a sand bin solar kiln beside a solar apparatus that melts salt, and heats sand through a high velocity nitrogen inert gas window by solar radiation in a stationary sand bed enthalpy exchanger having metal pipes pass close to a molten pool of sodium chloride that conducts heat to the sand where imbedded pipes heat high temperature liquid mercury, sulfur, liquid sodium, Calorie 43, Mobiltherm 600, and Therminol 66 in a stationary enthalpy exchanger. 7. An apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the area of the pivoted reflecting planes is varied to suit the angle between said reflecting plane and the vertical, becoming longer as the angle decreases. 8. An apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the radiation to enthalpy exchanger is a stationary heat source used for generating means.
