a microphone or a speaker; an electrochromic aesthetic, design or pictorial effect whereby the canvas support medium or image, responds to changes in electrical current by changing it's level of or it's state of: transparency, translucency, reflectivity, light emission employing conductive polymer, changing the path or color of the light passing through it, or a combination of these; or forming the canvas support medium with an electrochromic aesthetic, design or pictorial effect whereby the canvas support medium or image changes in response to changes in electrical current; (c) preparing an aesthetic effect in the canvas support medium with (i) and (ii): (i) at least one conductive polymer that emits light, that enables light emission or that is part of an OLED and also with (ii) one or more positive or negative forms that serve as: lenses, prisms, gratings, or as one or more of these that are part or all of an image support, such that this addition to the canvas support medium described in (ii) effects the canvas support medium's visible light or the visible light it emits; (d) preparing the canvas support medium or image with aesthetic effect is created by electricity that causes the positions of particles, of liquid crystals, or of liquid crystals in a polymer layer or matrix to change; (e) cleaning the canvas support medium or image sufficiently to render it receptive to conventional artist's paint and to provide enhanced bond strength and permanence to facilitate development of the aesthetic image; (f) preparing the canvas support medium with conductive polymer that enables or is part of one or more of: a device; a system; an electrical device, an electrical wire or conduit, a computer, computer memory, computer chip, computer hard disk or part of a computer, a computer controlled device, a light emitting device; a LED; an OLED or other light source; a device or another form that is opaque, transparent, translucent or a combination of these; a solar cell, a battery, an energy source, a transistor, a capacitor, a coating or a transparent coating, photovoltaics, a photodiode, a photoconductor, a photorefractive device, a sensor, or a means of detecting a person, sound, light or change in the environment; a means by which the canvas support medium can move visibly, emit music or emit sound; a conductive adhesive, a circuit, an ink, a paint, a colorant; a coating or a coating that is transparent or translucent; conductive fiber, fabric or fabric for use as a conventional canvas surface, a conventional painting surface or a conventional collage surface; a means of being interactive or part thereot a moving or changing picture or image, a video, a film or part thereof; an electroactive layer or part; or an aesthetic effect that uses electricity; or (g) forming or developing the canvas support medium or image using conventional image making practices or using conventional practices for making art.
