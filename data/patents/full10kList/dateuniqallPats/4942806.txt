A vehicular internal air exhausting device being accomplished by an air exhausting assembly and a power source supply assembly. The air exhausting assembly is mounted on the trunk compartment top plate behind the rear seat or any other suitable place of a vehicle, comprising of a bottom plate which unites all relative components and is positioned fixedly in using place, a motor seat which fixes a motor united with air-extracting blades, and a housing shell for enclosure of the motor and air-extracting blades and union with the bottom plate. When a vehicle is parked under sunlight in hot day, the solar power-collecting plate provided on the roof top of the vehicle will automatically generate light-electricity effects to charge the storage battery of the vehicle and with the electricity power of which the air exhausting assembly will be activated to eliminate the heated internal air out of the vehicle, making the temperature inside equal to the outside.
Claims I claim: 1. A vehicular internal air exhausting device which comprises: a power source supply assembly for supplying electricity power from a battery under control of a set of switches; an air exhausting assembly mounted on a trunk compartment top plate behind a vehicle seat for extracting the vehicular internal heated air toward said trunk compartment, said exhaust assembly comprising: a bottom plate, a motor seat, a motor having an output shaft, an air-extracting blades, and a cylindrical housing shell having an inner diameter; said bottom plate having an outlet in its center for the extracted air which enters the trunk compartment, screw holes near said bottom plate periphery for mounting to the trunk compartment top plate, and said bottom plate having an annular flange inside of and adapted to said housing shell inner diameter for connecting said top plate to said housing shell; said housing shell, containing said motor seat which is cone-formed and has a motor barrel in its center to accommodate said motor and aerofoils provided to bridge connection between said motor barrel and an outer circle of said motor seat; said motor united with said air-extracting blades at its output shaft; said housing shell having air intake cascades in its periphery and top areas, said motor being electrically connected to said power source supply assembly; wherein the vehicular internal temperature will become equal to the outside temperature. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said battery is a solar battery. 3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said battery is a vehicle storage battery.
