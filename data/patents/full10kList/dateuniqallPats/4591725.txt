A fail-safe, self-checking flame monitoring circuit is provided without the use of a mechanical shutter in which a photodetector provides a signal corresponding to flame intensity (including flicker), an amplifier amplifies the signal, the amplification is controlled by a negative feedback circuit in relation to the peak amplitude of the signal (including flicker) such that all frequencies down to DC are amplified equally, and all amplified signals are passed, without threshold, downstream for further processing.
Claims I claim: 1. A flame monitoring circuit comprising: (a) a detector for providing a direct current electrical signal, which varies in proportion to the intensity of the light striking the detector; (b) an amplifier for amplifying the signal of said detector; (c) a negative feedback network for controlling the gain of said amplifier in response to the highest peak value of the signal of said detector over a substantial period adapted to allow the amplification of all frequencies down to D.C., including flicker frequency, equally; and, (d) means for transmitting all frequencies detected by said detector downstream for further processing. 2. The flame monitoring circuit defined in claim 1 further characterized by: (e) said negative feedback network comprising a J Field Effect Transistor whose resistance is controlled by a varistor. 3. The flame monitoring circuit defined in claim 1 further characterized by: (f) a switch between said detector and said amplifier; and, (g) a timer for periodically opening and closing said switch to provide self-checking for the system. 4. The flame monitoring circuit of claim 3 further characterized by: (h) said detector being photovoltaic and thereby fail-safe. 5. The flame monitoring circuit defined in claim 3 further characterized by: (i) said switch being a slow acting photocoupler. 6. The flame monitoring circuit defined in claim 3 further characterized by: (j) said switch being an LED/CdS photocoupler.
