A solar heat collector apparatus is disclosed which includes a reflective surface of appropriate geometric form for receiving the solar radiation and reflecting said solar energy to a tube which is mounted at a point to maximize the collection of radiant energy. The collector is formed by moulding a plastic insulation material in a container which is then covered by a reflective metal film. The surface forms a series of compartments or cells which may be parabolic in shape. The cells communicate with each other to form a continuous fluid circuit. A second circuit is provided within the tube located in each compartment of the collector. The insulation characteristics of the container have been maximized to avoid heat losses through conducting parts.
