A timed alert device for vehicles having an electronic timer that counts down a specified time period. An audible alert coupled to the electronic timer projects a sound when the electronic timer has reached a prescribed time. A first actuating element is coupled to the electronic timer which deactivates the audible alert when depressed. A power source is coupled to and supplies power to the electronic timer. A visual alert illuminates when the electronic timer has reached a prescribed time. Depressing a second actuating element deactivates the visual alert.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A timed alert device for vehicles for indicating a timed vehicle event comprising: a circular housing having a front face, a back face and a surrounding edge; an electronic timer having a programmable computer chip disposed within said circular housing, wherein said electronic timer clocks a specified time period; an audible alert generator, disposed in said circular housing and in communication with said electronic timer, wherein said audible alert generator emits a sound when said electronic timer has reached a first prescribed time; a visual alert indicator disposed on said front face of said circular housing and in communication with said electronic timer, wherein said visual alert indicator activates when said electronic timer has reached a second prescribed time and specifies an amount of days remaining until the timed vehicle event, said visual alert indicator comprising a screen on which a visible message corresponding to the timed vehicle event appears, wherein said screen is backlit when said visual alert indicator is activated; a first actuating element disposed on the surrounding edge of said circular housing and in communication with said electronic timer, wherein depressing said first actuating element for a specified amount of time both deactivates said audible alert generator and said visual alert indicator; a second actuating element disposed on the surrounding edge of said circular housing and in communication with the programmable computer chip of said electronic timer for resetting said electronic timer to a new vehicle event, wherein said second actuating element can only be depressed with the use of a specially fitted tool, and wherein said second actuating element must be depressed for a specified amount of time to reset said electronic timer; a battery disposed in a battery compartment in said back face of said circular housing, and at least one solar cell strip disposed on said back face of said circular housing; said battery and said at least one solar cell strip being coupled to supply power to said electronic timer; wherein said time period relates to a time period between vehicle events, and said first prescribed time and said second prescribed time are to activate alerts indicating that said timed vehicle event will soon expire. 2. The timed alert device of claim 1 additionally comprising a plastic mounting bracket for fastening to the inside of the vehicle for receiving and supporting said circular housing. 3. The timed alert device of claim 2, wherein said plastic mounting bracket is affixed to a windshield of the vehicle, and is properly tilted so that a driver can see the timed alert device. 4. The timed alert device of claim 1, further comprising an adhesive disposed on said back face of said circular housing that allows the timed alert device to adhere to a windshield of a vehicle. 5. The timed alert device of claim 1, wherein said electronic timer times eleven (11) months. 6. The timed alert device of claim 1, wherein the timed vehicle event is an inspection. 7. The timed alert device of claim 1, wherein the timed vehicle event is registration renewal. 8. The timed alert device of claim 1, wherein the timed vehicle event is an oil change. 9. A timed alert device for vehicles for indicating a timed vehicle event comprising: a circular housing having a front face, a back face and a surrounding edge; an electronic timer having a programmable computer chip disposed within said circular housing, wherein said electronic timer clocks a specified time period: an audible alert generator, disposed in said circular housing and in communication with said electronic timer, wherein said audible alert generator emits a sound when said electronic timer has reached a first prescribed time; a visual alert indicator disposed on said front face of said circular housing and in communication with said electronic timer, wherein said visual alert indicator activates when said electronic timer has reached a second prescribed time and specifies an amount of days remaining until the timed vehicle event, said visual alert indicator comprising a screen on which a visible message selected from the group consisting of "inspection due", "oil change due" and "registration due" appears, wherein said screen is backlit when said visual alert indicator is activated; a first actuating element disposed on the surrounding edge of said circular housing and in communication with said electronic timer, wherein depressing said first actuating element for a specified amount of time both deactivates said audible alert generator and said visual alert indicator; a second actuating element disposed on the surrounding edge of said circular housing and in communication with the programmable computer chip of said electronic timer for resetting said electronic timer to a new vehicle event, wherein said second actuating element can only be depressed with the use of a specially fitted tool, and wherein said second actuating element must be depressed for a specified amount of time to reset said electronic timer; a battery disposed in a battery compartment in said back face of said circular housing; and at least one solar cell strip disposed on said back face of said circular housing; said battery and said at least one solar cell strip being coupled to supply power to said electronic timer; wherein said time period relates to a time period between vehicle events, and said first prescribed time and said second prescribed time are to activate alerts indicating that said timed vehicle event will soon expire. 10. A timed alert device for vehicles for indicating a timed vehicle event comprising: a circular housing having a front face, a back face and a surrounding edge: an electronic timer having a programmable computer chip disposed within said circular housing, wherein said electronic timer clocks a specified time period; an audible alert generator, disposed in said circular housing and in communication with said electronic timer, wherein said audible alert generator emits a sound when said electronic timer has reached a first prescribed time; a visual alert indicator disposed on said front face of said circular housing and in communication with said electronic timer, wherein said visual alert indicator activates when said electronic timer has reached a second proscribed time and specifies an amount of days remaining until the timed vehicle event, said visual alert indicator comprising a screen with the words "inspection due", wherein said screen is backlit when said visual alert indicator is activated; a first actuating element disposed on the surrounding edge of said circular housing and in communication with said electronic timer, wherein depressing said first actuating element for a specified amount of time both deactivates said audible alert generator and said visual alert indicator; a second actuating element disposed on the surrounding edge of said circular housing and in communication with the programmable computer chip of said electronic timer for resetting said electronic timer to a new vehicle event, wherein said second actuating element can only be depressed with the use of a specially fitted tool, and wherein said second actuating element must be expressed for a specified amount of time to reset said electronic timer; a battery disposed in a battery compartment in said back face of said circular housing; and at least one solar cell strip disposed on said back face of said circular housing; said battery and said at least one solar cell strip being coupled to supply power to said electronic timer; wherein said time period relates to a time period between vehicle events, and said first prescribed time and said second prescribed time are to activate alerts indicating that said timed vehicle event will soon expire.
