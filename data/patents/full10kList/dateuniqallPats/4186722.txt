A solar energy collecting and storing unit comprises a single housing having a glass-covered collector chamber on one face of a gravel-filled heat storage chamber, the chambers being separated by an insulated partition. The collector comprises an array of L-shaped metal fins over which air is caused to flow in a predetermined path by baffles. A first air flow circuit between the storage chamber and the collector chamber picks up heat absorbed by the fins and transfers it to gravel in the heat storage chamber. A second air flow circuit transfers heat from the storage chamber to the building to be heated.
Claims I now claim: 1. In a solar energy collecting and storing unit utilizing a heat collecting chamber defined by a front transparent sheet through which solar energy may enter, a thermally insulated back wall substantially parallel to the front sheet, and thermally insulated side walls completing the enclosure of the chamber, an inlet port through which air to be heated may be admitted to the chamber, an outlet port through which heated air may leave the chamber, and a system of baffles substantially bridging the space between the front sheet and the back wall and defining a predetermined path for air traversing the chamber between the inlet and outlet ports, the improved solar energy absorbing means which comprises: a plurality of elongated sheet metal fins, each fin having a generally L-shaped cross section defined by a first leg lying in a plane substantially parallel to the back wall and a second leg extending substantially perpendicularly away from its intersection with said first leg and toward the front sheet but with the free end of said second leg terminating at a point spaced from the front sheet to define an air flow channel between said free ends and the front sheet, both legs of said fins being darkened to provide maximum absorption of solar energy; said fins and the baffles being mounted within said chamber so that said free ends of said fins extend perpendicularly to the direction of air flow along the predetermined path and through said channel. 2. The solar energy collector of claim 1 wherein said fins are mounted within the chamber in a manner which leaves substantially the full area of all four faces of each fin exposed to the air flow along the predetermined path. 3. The solar energy collector of claim 1 wherein said first leg of each fin has a short flange along the edge remote from the intersection with said second leg, said flange acting as a fin locator during assembly when the free edge of said flange of each fin is abutted against the second leg of a parallel adjacent fin. 4. In a solar energy collecting and storing unit utilizing a heat collecting chamber defined by a front transparent sheet through which solar energy may enter, a thermally insulated back wall substantially parallel to the front sheet, and thermally insulated side walls completing the enclosure of the chamber, an inlet port through which air to be heated may be admitted to the chamber, an outlet port through which heated air may leave the chamber, and a system of baffles substantially bridging the space between the front sheet and the back wall and defining a predetermined path for air traversing the chamber between the inlet and outlet ports, the improved solar energy absorbing means which comprises: a plurality of elongated sheet metal fins, each fin having a generally L-shaped cross section defined by a first leg lying in a plane substantially parallel to the back wall and a second leg extending substantially perpendicularly away from its intersection with said first leg and toward the front sheet but with the free end of said second leg terminating at a point spaced from the front sheet to define an air flow channel between said free ends and the front sheet, both legs of said fins being darkened to provide maximum absorption of solar energy; the baffles being mounted on the back wall and arranged parallel to each other in such a way that the predetermined air flow path is a single serpentine path traversing substantially the full area of the chamber; a plurality of mounting strips extending parallel to the baffles and mounted within the chamber on the back wall, said fins being secured to said mounting strips with their lengths extending in a direction perpendicular to the mounting strips and baffles, said mounting strips spacing said fins from the back wall to allow air flow around all surfaces of said fins; whereby the air flowing along the predetermined path parallel to and between the baffles flows in two parallel planes, one plane lying between said first legs of said fins and the back wall, and the second coinciding with said air flow channel, the air flow in said air flow channel also swirling down into the spaces between the second legs of said fins to remove heat therefrom and from the surface of said first legs facing the front sheet.
