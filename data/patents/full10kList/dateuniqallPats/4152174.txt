A solar energy collector using rhombic photoelectric plates arranged in an array of connected plates and mounted in a housing can be positioned on a universal mount which is movable on a tracking servo using a position analyzer and a sun position sensor to direct the positioning of the solar collector housing. A lenticular surface on the cover of the housing can intensify the collection of solar energy within the individual photoelectric plates. A small portable tracking servo unit could be mounted on a camper or in another suitable location or the housing may be attached to a portable radio.
Claims What I claim and seek to secure by Letters Patent is: 1. A solar energy collecting device, comprising an array of photo cell plates mounted in a housing, and means of mounting the housing connected to the housing, wherein each of the photo cells of the array of photo cells is a rhomboid shaped flat photo cell, and with each cell mounted to extend at an angle to the base of the housing. 2. The device of claim 1, wherein an acute angle of each of two opposing corners of each of the photo cell plates is substantially a 60.degree. angle. 3. The device of claim 2, wherein the means of mounting the housing is a universal mounting, and the universal mounting is attached to a tracking servo device. 4. The device of claim 2, wherein the means of mounting the housing is a universal mounting, and the universal mounting is attached to a tracking servo device, and wherein the tracking servo device has a position analyser mounted in the tracking servo device, and a sun position sensor is mounted in the tracking servo device, and is connected to the position analyser.
