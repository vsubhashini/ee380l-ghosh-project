A tracking system is provided for pivotally mounted spaced-apart solar collectors. A pair of cables is connected to spaced-apart portions of each collector, and a driver displaces the cables, thereby causing the collectors to pivot about their mounting, so as to assume the desired orientation. The collectors may be of the cylindrical type as well as the flat-plate type. Rigid spar-like linkages may be substituted for the cables. Releasable attachments of the cables to the collectors is also described, as is a fine tuning mechanism for precisely aligning each individual collector.
Claims The embodiments of this invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A solar collector tracking system comprising; at least one solar collector; pivotal mounting means attached to said solar collector; at least two linkage means connected to said collector at spaced-apart portions thereof, said linkage means including elongated electrically insulated electrical conductor portions; drive means for displacing said linkage means so as to cause said solar collector to pivot, thereby aligning said solar collector in a predetermined direction; fine tuning adjustment means including a frame supported from said linkage means; a follower connected to said collector; an elongated shaft connected to said frame, said shaft threadingly engaged with said follower; an electric motor, connected to said shaft for rotational drive thereof; and fine tuning adjustment means including means electrically connecting said conductor portions to said motor. 2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said follower includes means for releasably engaging said collector. 3. A solar collector tracking and support system comprising: at least one solar collector; first and second cables separately connected to said solar collector at spaced-apart portions thereof, said first and said secnd cables and said solar collector connected together to form a first closed loop such that said first and said second cables support forces on said solar collector which extend generally parallel to said first and said second cables; pivotal mounting means attached to said solar collector so as to support generally vertical forces acting on said solar collector and said firt and said second cables, said solar collector being mounted thereby for pivotal movement in azimuthal and elevational directions; a first drive means for displacing said first and said second cables so as to cause said solar collector to pivot, said first and said second cables cooperating with said first drive means to provide azimuthal alignment of said solar collector; third and fourth cables separably connected to said solar collector spaced-apart portions thereof; a second drive means for displacing said third and said fourth cables so as to cause said solar collector to pivot, thereby providing elevational alignment of said solar collector, said third and said fourth cables and said solar collector connected together to form a second closed loop such that said third and said fourth cables support forces on said solar collector which extend generally parallel to said third and said fourth cables; separable connection means includes with each of said cables for separable connection to said solar collector; and connection control means for selectively connecting and disconnecting said separable connection means with respect to spaced-apart alternating portions of said solar collector. 4. The apparatus of claim 3 wherein said separable connection means and said connection control means comprise null means for displacing said solar collector through a horizontal null position, and said separable connection means comprises a pair of jaws movable to a closed and an open position, means for biasing said jaws in one of said closed and said open positions, means for selectively overriding said biasing means to maintain said jaws in the other of said closed and said open positions.
