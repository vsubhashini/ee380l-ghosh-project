A modular passive solar energy storage system comprises a plurality of heat tubes which are arranged to form a flat plate solar collector and are releasably connected to a water reservoir by, and are part of, double-walled heat exchangers which penetrate to the water reservoir and enhance the heat transfer characteristics between the collector and the reservoir. The flat plate collector-heat exchanger disassembly, the collector housing, and the reservoir are integrated into a relatively light weight, unitary structural system in which the reservoir is a primary structural element. In addition to light weight, the system features high efficiency and ease of assembly and maintenance.
Claims Having thus described the preferred embodiment of my modular passive solar heating system, what is claimed is: 1. A passive solar energy storage system comprising: a tank for releasably storing heat in a fluid such as water contained therein; at least one heat tube for releasably storing radiant energy incident thereon as heat in a vaporizable fluid contained therein and having at least one axial heat collector fin; a double-walled heat exchanger comprising first and second tubes, the first tube being releasably mounted to and extending into the interior of the tank and itself being adapted to slidably receive the heat tube as the second tube thereof for transferring heat stored in the vaporizable heat tube fluid to the reservoir fluid medium; the double-walled heat exchanger having at least one channel formed between the first and second tubes for venting the interior space to the ambient; a heat tube housing comprising a lower base having a peripheral wall structure extending upwardly therefrom, the housing forming a unitary structural system with the tank such that the tank provides structural support to the housing; and the housing having first and second oppositely situated openings formed in the wall structure for receiving the heat tube, and further comprising a support plate extending transverse to the heat tube and having a profile corresponding to the transverse cross-section outline of the finned heat tube for supporting the heat tube in a selected orientation and for permitting sliding insertion of the heat tube into and removal of the heat tube from the tank. 2. The system of claim 1, wherein the heat tube further comprises a valve affixed to the end thereof spaced from the reservoir for supplying an operative quantity of evaporable medium. 3. The system of claim 1 further comprising a plurality of brackets rigidly interconnecting the tank to the housing and being adapted for supporting the system on an external surface. 4. A modular passive solar energy storage system comprising: a reservoir for releasably storing heat in a fluid such as water contained therein; at least one heat tube for releasably storing radiant energy incident thereon as heat in a vaporizable fluid contained therein and having at least one heat collector fin extending longitudinally along one side thereof; a double-walled heat exchanger comprising first and second tubes, the first tube being releasably mounted to and extending into the interior of the reservoir and itself being adapted to slidably mount the heat tube as the second tube thereof for transferring heat stored in the vaporizable heat tube fluid to the reservoir fluid medium, the double-walled heat exchanger having at least an axial groove formed between the first and second tubes for venting to the ambient; a heat tube housing; and mounting bracket means connected to and forming a unitary structural system with the reservoir and housing such that the reservoir provides structural support to the housing, the housing being adapted to support and align the heat tube or plurality of heat tubes. 5. A modular passive solar energy storage system comprising: a reservoir for releasably storing heat in a fluid such as water contained therein; at least one heat tube for releasably storing radiant energy incident thereon as heat in a vaporizable fluid contained therein and having at least one heat collector fin extending longitudinally along one side thereof; a double-walled heat exchanger comprising first and second tubes, the first tube being releasably mounted to and extending into the interior of the reservoir and itself being adapted to slidably mount the heat tube as the second tube thereof for transferring heat stored in the vaporizable heat tube fluid to the reservoir fluid medium, the double-walled heat exchanger having at least an axial groove formed between the first and second tubes for venting to the ambient; and a heat tube housing mounted to and forming a unitary structure with the reservoir, the housing comprising a lower base having a peripheral wall structure extending upwardly therefrom and an optically transparent upper base; the housing having first and second oppositely situated apertures formed in the wall structure for receiving a plurality of heat tubes, and further comprising a support plate extending substantially transverse to the heat tubes and having a support profile corresponding to the transverse cross-section outline of the heat tubes for supporting and orienting the said heat tubes in a substantially flat array. 6. The solar energy storage system of claim 5 wherein the heat tube further comprises a valve affixed thereto for supplying an operative quantity of evaporable medium and for venting the heat tube.
