The present solar energy collecting system in which a plurality of water heating apparatuses are serially connected to each other by a tube socket and union and is retained securely in the case having a transparent window. Each water heating apparatus comprises a light collecting tube, a concave reflector, a water tube and end caps having an opening. The upper half surface of the light collecting tube is transparent to transmission of the incident solar rays and the remaining lower half surface is a concave reflector to converge the incident solar rays along both sides of the water tube. The water tube is disposed in the light collecting tube enclosed at its ends by the caps. The body portion of the water tube is a configuration of a flat tube to rapidly heat up water and its end portion is a cylinder type of tube to connect rotatably through the opening of the cap to the tube socket. Accordingly, the present system is useful even in a winter season or cloudy days which the sunny time is short since it can obtain more rapidly and continuously a higher degree of hot water and also it is possible to install the system on a ramp such as a roof, or even on the wall since the apparatus can be rotated on the tube socket to face the incident light. In case of installing it on the ramp, the window is a transparent plane window and on the wall, it is a window having zigzag surfaces to face parallel to each concave reflector, respectively.
