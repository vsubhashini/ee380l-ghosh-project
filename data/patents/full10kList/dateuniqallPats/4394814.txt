An energy generation system includes a motive fluid which is alternately heated and cooled to drive a heat engine. An inexpensively built and operated system heats the motive fluid with solar radiation and cools it with atmospheric or wind cooling. Low cost solar heat collectors are fabricated with aluminum foil or aluminized Mylar reflective surface overlying parabolically shaped paperboard bases. Low cost fluid cooling devices are fabricated from various fluid carrying porous canvas bags, some being provided with wind catching devices.
