A floating marker for marking the location of a line in the water. The marker has a cylindrical shape and includes a pair of clips for attaching to a line while allowing the marker to move along the line. The marker includes a lighting module having a plurality of LEDs for illuminating the marker at during low visibility conditions, e.g. at night. The lighting module also includes a solar collector for charging a power source during the day. Finally, the lighting module includes a light sensor and controller allowing the amount of light emitted from the marker to be controlled either automatically or manually.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A buoyant marker for floating on the surface of a body of water comprising; a housing having a cylindrical shape with an outer surface extending along an axis between opposite ends and presenting an open interior chamber, said housing being of a translucent material for allowing light to pass through said housing, each of said opposite ends being frusto-conical with integral caps to render said chamber closed, a pair of flanges axially spaced from one another and extending radially outward from said outer surface of said housing, each of said flanges presenting a pair of apertures, a first clip extending through one of said apertures on one of said flanges and a second clip extending through one of said apertures on the other of said flanges for receiving a line to attach said housing to the line, said housing presenting a mounting opening in said outer surface, a lighting module disposed in said interior chamber of said translucent housing for illuminating said translucent housing, said lighting module including a solar collector disposed in said mounting opening in said outer surface of said housing for receiving ambient light and for converting the ambient light to electricity, said lighting module including a box disposed in said interior chamber and having a bottom and sides and an open top, said solar collector closing said open top of said box, an o-ring disposed between said solar collector and said box for sealing said box to said solar collector and for preventing fluid from entering said box, a seal sealing said lighting module to said housing in said mounting opening, a pair of trays disposed in said box with said trays abutting opposite sides of said box for containing a plurality of batteries, said bottom of said box presenting an opening having a rectangular shape between said trays in said box, said lighting module including a bracket having a U-shape presenting a base and a pair of legs extending perpendicularly away from said base through said opening of said bottom of said box, said lighting module including a plurality of light emitters being spaced from one another and supported by said legs and base of said bracket for emitting light, said light emitters being LEDs, a plate extending between said legs of said bracket and including a plurality of electrical contacts spaced from one another and electrically connected to said LEDs, said electrical contacts of said plate being electrically connected to said trays for establishing electrical communication between the batteries in said trays and said LEDs, at least two of said sides of said box presenting a notch aligned with said rectangular opening, each of said legs of said bracket defining a hook mating with said notches of said box to interconnect said bracket and said box, a plurality of reflectors having conical shapes disposed around said LEDs for focusing light emitted by said LEDs, said lighting module including a light sensor disposed on said outer surface of said housing for sensing ambient light, and said lighting module including a controller electrically connected to said light sensor and said LEDs and having an on mode for powering said LEDs and having an off mode for removing power from said LEDs and having an auto mode for powering said LEDs only in response to the ambient light sensed by said light sensor being less than a predetermined threshold.
