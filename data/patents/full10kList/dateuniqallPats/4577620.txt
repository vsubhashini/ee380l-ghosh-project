A multiple array of hemispheric lenses which focus solar rays onto heat-absorbing metal spheres embedded inside the lenses, and a conduit formed by the hemispheric lenses, a glass plate mounted above the lenses and two opposed parallel vertical side walls. Heat absorbed by the metal spheres is conducted upward through the lenses to water circulating through the conduit to the point of use.
Claims I claim: 1. A hemispheric solar panel comprising; an array of multiple hemispheric lenses (1) having concentric outer and inner spherical faces and arranged in parallel rows and integrally mounted on a planar glass base plate (8) occupying a horizontal plane below said hemispheric lenses (1), multiple solid heat-absorbing metal spheres (2) embedded in the center of said hemispheric lenses (1), a metal base plate (12) mounted below said glass base plate (8), a sheet (14) of thermal insulation mounted below said metal base plate (12), a top glass plate (4) mounted above said hemispheric lenses (1) and spatially separated therefrom, two opposed parallel vertical side walls (9), two opposed parallel vertical end walls, a fluid conduit (7) having a top formed by said top glass plate (4), having a base formed by said hemispheric lenses (1) and by said glass base plate (8), having sides formed by said two opposed parallel vertical side walls (9), and having ends formed by said two opposed parallel vertical end walls, an inlet pipe (10) opening into said fluid conduit (7) through one said parallel end wall, and an outlet pipe (11) opening into said fluid conduit (7) through the opposite said parallel end wall; said hemispheric lenses (1) serving as mounting means of said metal spheres (2), serving as means of focusing solar beams (6) onto said metal spheres (2), serving as means of absorbing heat from said metal spheres (2) and conducting the heat to a fluid flowing through said fluid conduit (7), and serving as a basal portion of said fluid conduit (7), said glass base plate (8) serving as mounting means of said hemispheric lenses (1) and serving as a basal portion of said fluid conduit (7), said metal spheres (2) serving as elements which absorb the heat of said solar beams (6) and which release the heat to said hemispheric lenses (1) and to said metal base plate (12), said metal base plate (12) serving as an element which absorbs the heat of solar beams (13) and of said metal spheres (2) and which releases the heat to said glass base plate (8), said top glass plate (4) serving as a window which transmits solar beams (3) to said hemispheric lenses (1) and to said glass base plate (8), said fluid conduit (7) serving as a channel through which a heat-transfer fluid flows.
