A solar panel in which interconnected photovoltaic cells are maintained in light-receiving position by electrically conductive clips secured to the base of the panel. When the cells and clips are encapsulated in a protective resin, a vacuum is drawn during encapsulation to remove air bubbles trapped beneath the cells.
Claims I claim: 1. A method of forming a solar panel for maintaining a plurality of photovoltaic cells in interconnected relationship and in position to receive light impinging thereon and convert light energy into electrical energy, comprising, providing a tray within which said cells are to be retained, said tray including a base member, mounting electrically conductive clips on said base member in spaced relationship to enable adjacent clips to accommodate cells between them, inserting at least one cell between each pair of adjoining clips so that, through one of said clips, electrical contact is effected between the top surface or bottom surface electrode of one cell and the bottom surface or top surface electrode of the next adjacent cell held by said clip, overlying said cells and said clips with a liquid encapsulant having optical properties enabling quantities of light to pass therethrough, and curing the encapsulant to a firm state whereby said cells are maintained in light-receiving position while being cushioned and protected from ambient conditions by said encapsulant. 2. A method of forming a solar panel as claimed in claim 1, in which after or while said cells and said clips are overlaid with said liquid encapsulant, said tray is subjected to subatmospheric pressure to remove any trapped air bubbles.
