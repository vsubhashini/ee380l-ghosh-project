A solar heated anaerobic digestor is provided, adapted to utilize organic material capable of decomposing to produce methane gas and a liquid fertilizer. The sealed anaerobic digestor is wrapped with a layer of heat absorptive material followed by a series of abutting removable panels of insulative material. Insulative panels may be temporarily removed to expose the heat absorptive material to solar radiation and may be replaced when the solar radiation diminishes. A layer of transparent material wrapped in outwardly spaced relation around the insulatng panels is capable of transmitting solar radiation while providing protection against environmental elements. Additional heating means extending into the digestor provide auxiliary heat as required.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A solar heated anaerobic digestor adapted to utilize a slurry of organic material capable of decomposing to produce a liquid fertilizer and methane gas, comprising: sealed digestor container means having adjoining upper and lower portions defined by upper and lower side wall segments, the lower portion of which is operative to contain the organic material and the upper portion of which is capable of containing the gas produced; means, connected to and communicating with the sealed container means, for introducing the slurry into the container means; means, connected to the container means and communicating with the lower portion, for draining slurry product from the container means; means, connected to and communicating with the upper portion of the container means, for withdrawing gas produced; means in the lower portion for stirring the slurry; secondary heating means for heating the slurry present in the lower portion; a layer of heat absorptive material wrapped around the lower side wall segment; a plurality of abutting removable panels of insulative material enclosing the layer of heat absorptive material; a layer of insulative material wrapped around the upper side wall segment of the container means; a layer of transparent material wrapped around the panels and the upper side wall insulative material; said layer of transparent material being spaced outwardly from the insulating panels, whereby some of the panels may be temporarily removed to permit solar radiation to heat an exposed portion of the heat absorptive material, and may be replaced when the solar radiation diminishes, thereby enabling a combination of solar heat and heat obtained from the secondary heating means to be used to maintain the temperature of the contained slurry at a desirable level; first frame means attached to the container for mounting the heat absorptive material and insulative material and insulative panels; and second frame means spaced outwardly from the lower side wall segment for mounting the transparent material around the lower side wall segment. 2. The solar heated anaerobic digestor as set forth in claim 1 wherein: the means for draining the slurry comprises an effluent line extending from within the slurry to the exterior of the sealed container means in a manner such that pressure extending by the gas produced within the sealed container forces the slurry to drain from the container means; and the stirring means comprises gas bubbling means 3. The solar heated anaerobic digestor as set forth in claim 2, which further comprises: a layer of transparent material attached to the first frame means between the panels and the heat absorptive material covering the lower side wall segment operative to trap air between the heat absorptive material and the transparent material.
