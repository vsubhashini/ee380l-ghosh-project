A roof panel with solar batteries and a roof structure with solar batteries, which can improve water blocking between adjacent solar batteries integral with the roof panel. On the inclined surface of the roof Y is disposed the base panel 2, on which support rails 37 (each having a two-stage structure with a gutter and a cylindrical section 37a and 37b) are provided. A plurality of solar battery panels 3, provided with a frame (having an upper and a lower frame member 6 and 7 and paired vertical frame members 8) therearound, are each provided between paired support frames 37. The lower frame member 7 has an extension 25 extending from its side nearer the eaves N and covering the upper frame member 6 of the adjacent panel 3. The base and solar battery panels 2 and 3 are made integral with one another in the factory to be supplied as a roof panel 1 with solar batteries. With this structure, water is blocked around the solar battery panel 3 by the frame (6 to 8) therearound. Rainwater having fallen onto the surface of the panel 3 is drained along the extension 25 to the panel 3 on the side of the eaves N, or is led side-wise to support rails (i.e., gutter sections 37a thereof) to be drained to the side of the eaves N.
