A photovoltaic mounting apparatus for use with a solar panel includes a base element having an elongated upper portion and a lower portion. The upper portion is structured for engagement with a rooftop by being positioning underneath the shingles of a rooftop and secured thereto through the apertures of the upper portion and/or lower portion of the base element. One or more support elements extend perpendicularly from the lower portion of the base element. A front plate is situated upon the support elements and is parallel to the base element and structured for engagement with the solar panel.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A rooftop photovoltaic mounting system comprising: a rooftop comprising a plurality of shingles; a solar panel; at least one photovoltaic mounting apparatus comprising: a base element having an upper portion and a lower portion, the upper portion being positioned under at least one of said shingles and engaged with said rooftop; at least one support element extending from the lower portion of said base element, and a front plate situated upon said support element, said front plate having an aperture and being parallel to said base element; at least one hooking device comprising: a body having an aperture corresponding to the aperture of said front plate, said body engaging said solar panel, and a hook engaging said front plate; and means for securing the body of said hooking device and said front plate at the apertures thereof. 2. The rooftop photovoltaic mounting system of claim 1 wherein said base element includes at least one aperture, said base element being engaged with said rooftop by a securing system at said at least one aperture of said base element. 3. The rooftop photovoltaic mounting system of claim 1 wherein a safety securing hook is secured to said base element.
