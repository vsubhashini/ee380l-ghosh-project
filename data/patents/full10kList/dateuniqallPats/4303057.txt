A swimming pool solar heater is disclosed comprising a plurality of sunlight condenser elements each having a plurality of condensing lenses secured in a frame. The plurality of condenser elements are rotatably mounted relative to a base for condensing the sunlight and projecting the condensed sunlight on to the water within the swimming pool. A motor drives a shaft for simultaneously rotating the plurality of sunlight condenser elements to compensate for the relative movement between the sun and the earth and maintain the condensed sunlight impinging upon the water within the swimming pool. The foregoing abstract is merely a resume of one general application, is not a complete discussion of all principles of operation or applications, and is not to be construed as a limitation on the scope of the claimed subject matter.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A swimming pool solar heater, comprising in combination: a plurality of sunlight condenser elements each having a plurality of condensing lenses secured in a frame; mounting means for rotatably mounting each of said sunlight condenser elements for projecting a portion of the condensed sunlight onto the water within the swimming pool; motor means for rotating said plurality of condenser elements to compensate for the relative movement between the sun and the earth thereby maintaining the projection of the condensed sunlight onto the water within the swimming pool; each of said condenser elements being supported by a support shaft; a base disposed along the edge of the swimming pool; said base including a plurality of sockets for removably securing said support shafts of said plurality of condenser elements; means for varying the angular orientation of said sockets relative to the earth for adjusting the position of said condenser elements in accordance with the latitude of the installation; said motor means comprising a drive shaft extending along said base; a plurality of drive means spaced along said drive shaft for simultaneously rotating said plurality of sockets for rotating said plurality of condenser elements; said drive means comprising a plurality of gears spaced along said drive shaft for engagement with gears secured to said plurality of sockets; said sockets being keyed for removably receiving said support shafts enabling said sunlight condenser elements to be installed within said base in the identical orientation with respect to the swimming pool from which said sunlight condenser elements were oriented prior to being removed from said base. 2. A swimming pool heater as set forth in claim 1, wherein each of said condensing lenses of each of said condenser elements is disposed in a single plane. 3. A swimming pool heater as set forth in claim 1, wherein said condensing lenses of each of said condenser elements are disposed in multiple planes enabling at least one of said condensing lens to be positioned to overlap another of said condensing lenses thereby defining an overlapped portion which assures that the sunlight passing therethrough will travel in a linear path rather than being focused by said condenser element.
