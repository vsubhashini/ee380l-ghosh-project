A method and system of determining and displaying energy savings from an HVAC system operating in an energy saving mode. The HVAC system is operated to maintain a comfort mode temperature during a learning period. The energy consumed by the HVAC system at multiple outside ambient conditions during the learning period is determined. The correlation between a specific ambient condition and energy consumed by the HVAC system is determined. The HVAC system is run to maintain an energy saving setpoint temperature. The energy consumed by the HVAC system is determined at an ambient condition while maintaining the energy saving setpoint temperature. The energy savings are calculated as a function of the difference between the energy that would have been consumed by the HVAC system at the ambient condition based on the determined correlation and the energy consumed by the HVAC system while maintaining the energy saving setpoint temperature at the ambient condition.
