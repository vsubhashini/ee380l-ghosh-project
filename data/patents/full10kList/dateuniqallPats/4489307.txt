A handle stem for a bicycle which comprises a stem body, a projecting portion extending radially outwardly from the top of the body, and a holding portion provided at the utmost end of the projecting portion, and is provided at the upper portions of the projecting portion and holding portion with a mounting surface made continuous on the same plane so that on the mounting surface is mounted a box of a display apparatus for electrically displaying operation, such as speed or a running distance, of the bicycle, the box being formed about the same in shape and plane size as the mounting surface.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A handle stem for a bicycle comprising a stem body, a projecting portion having an elongated recessed mounting portion and extending radially outwardly of said stem body from a top thereof, a holding portion provided at a distal end of said projecting portion and having a deformable clamp defining an insertion bore for receiving a handle bar, and a display apparatus which electrically displays operating conditions of the bicycle, said display apparatus including a box member mounted in said mounting portion and containing electric parts for producing a display of at least one operating condition of a bicycle, said electric parts including a means for processing at least one signal representative of said operating condition of the bicycle and a display unit connected to said signal processing means and mounted at the surface of said box member, said display unit displaying said operating condition, said box member having an elongate shape extending longitudinally of said projecting portion and holding portion at said handle stem, said box member having at a front portion thereof said display unit and at a rear portion thereof a control unit and housing within the front portion said electric parts and within the rear portion a power source. 2. A handle stem for a bicycle according to claim 1, wherein said power source employs a solar battery. 3. A handle stem for a bicycle comprising a stem body, a projecting portion having an elongated recessed mounting portion and extending radially outwardly of said stem body from a top thereof, a holding portion provided at a distal end of said projecting portion and having a deformable clamp defining an insertion bore for receiving a handle bar, and a display apparatus which electrically displays operating conditions of the bicycle, said projecting portion and holding portion having at their upper portions a mounting surface for receiving and supporting said display apparatus; said mounting surface being elongated and continuous on the same plane, said display apparatus including a box member mounted in said mounting portion and containing electric parts for producing a display of at least one operating condition of a bicycle, said electric parts including a means for processing at least one signal representative of said operating condition of the bicycle and a display unit connected to said signal processing means and mounted at the surface of said box member, said display unit displaying said operating condition, said box member being of about the same shape and planar size as said mounting surface and being mounted on and supported by said mounting surface, said projecting portion having upstanding wall members between which said display apparatus is mounted, said upstanding wall members covering at least a portion of the lateral sides of said box member. 4. A handle stem for a bicycle according to claim 3, wherein the center of said insertion bore at said projecting portion is positioned downwardly from a longitudinally extending center line of a vertical length of said projecting portion. 5. A handle stem for a bicycle according to claim 3, wherein said mounting surface at said projecting portion and holding portion is positioned downwardly with respect to the top of said stem body so that said display apparatus, when mounted on said mounting surface, is about level at the upper surface with the top of said stem body. 6. A handle stem for a bicycle according to claim 3, wherein said display apparatus has a mounting shaft having a length larger than a vertical length of said projecting portion which extends downwardly, said projecting portion having a mounting bore through which said mounting shaft projects so that said mounting shaft, when said display apparatus is mounted on said mounting surface, projects through said mounting bore and downwardly from a lower surface of said projecting portion, said mounting shaft having a fixing means for fixing said mounting shaft to said projecting portion. 7. A handle stem for a bicycle according to claim 6, wherein said mounting shaft is hollow and serves as a conduit for drawing to the exterior a wire which electrically connects with said display apparatus.
