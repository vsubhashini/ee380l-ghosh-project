The present invention relates to a system and method for detecting bats from a remote location. In one aspect the invention provides a bat detection system comprising an upper detection unit connected to a base computer unit. The upper detection unit can be positioned on a vertical structure, and a second lower detection unit, or additional detection units, can also be positioned on the vertical structure. Each detection unit comprises a housing which is connected to, and contains, an audio detector. The base computer unit is enclosed by a housing and comprises a data processor, a data storage device, and a remote communication interface device. The data processor is operatively connected to the data storage device, remote communication interface device, and the audio detectors of any detection units positioned on the vertical structure. The base computer unit communicates with a remote computer transferring information regarding the bat sounds detected by the detection units.
