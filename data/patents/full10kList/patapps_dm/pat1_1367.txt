A shrew-expelling device with an illumination function, the device is comprised of an electric circuitry, a main stem and a housing; wherein, the electric circuitry includes a power supplying circuit, a sound emitting circuit and a light emitting circuit, the power supplying circuit generates electricity in taking advantage of a solar-energy powered electricity generating element. The device with a buzzer and a light emitting element therein makes sound which is abominated by rodents and illuminates respectively; and thereby, the device has an effect of expelling rats and illuminating; wherein, by providing various modeling formed from a housing and a main stem, the device can completely immersed into the scenery of the environment to even beautify the latter.
Claims Having thus described the present invention with industrial value, what I claim as new and desire to be secured by Letters Patent of the United States are: 1. A shrew-expelling device with an illumination function, said device is comprised of an electric circuitry, a main stem and a housing; wherein, said electric circuitry includes a power supplying circuit, a sound emitting circuit and a light emitting circuit, said power supplying circuit generates electricity in taking advantage of a solar-energy powered electricity generating element, the power is stored in a rechargeable battery; said sound emitting circuit generates signals in taking advantage of said sound emitting circuit to make sound of a buzzer which emits sound waves with frequencies below 1000 Hz; while said light emitting circuit is powered by said power supplying circuit to make illumination of a light emitting element; said main stem is a hollow stem, said main stem is provided on the top end thereof with a connecting portion to connect said housing; the bottom end of said main stem is in the form of a cone for inserting of said main stem into the soil; said housing has a receiving space therein to receive said electric circuitry, and is provided on the bottom thereof with a connecting pipe to be cooperated in connection with said connecting portion of said main stem, thereby, said housing is connected with said main stem; said electric circuitry is combined in said main stem and said housing, and said connecting pipe of said housing is engaged and connected with said connecting portion on said top end of said main stem, thus said shrew-expelling device with an illumination function is completed. 2. The shrew-expelling device with an illumination function as in claim 1, wherein, said main stem is made from a plurality of hollow rods, each of said rods is provided on one end thereof with a connecting portion to allow connecting of every two neighboring ones of said rods by slipping one over the other; a socket is provided in each of said connecting portions for connecting of electric wires. 3. The shrew-expelling device with an illumination function as in claim 1, wherein, said housing is provided with a transparent lamp shade in the form of a bowel, and is provided on the top thereof with an annular connecting cover which is connected on the top thereof with a transparent semispherical hood; a lamp shade and said connecting cover of said housing are provided therein with an electric circuit base for fixing said electric circuitry and a power generating base for mounting a power generating element to generate electricity in taking advantage of solar energy, said electric circuit base is s provided therebeneath with an inner lamp shade and a light-emitting element seat to receive said light emitting element and to reflect light. 4. The shrew-expelling device with an illumination function as in claim 1, wherein, said buzzer in said electric circuitry is embedded in the bottom end of said main stem. 5. The shrew-expelling device with an illumination function as in claim 1, wherein, said buzzer is set to make sound intermittently.
