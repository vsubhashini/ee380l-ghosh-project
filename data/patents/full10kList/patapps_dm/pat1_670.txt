A tracking unit for solar collectors has at least two panels, which can each be pivoted about a longitudinal axis. The axes are arranged on a rotable frame on one plane. The position of each axis within the individual panels is offset by a offset .DELTA.x in relation to the adjacent panels. The individual panels are moved by means of a lifting mechanism that pivots each of the panels about the same angle. This arrangement significantly reduces mutual shading and increases efficiency by about 10%.
Claims 1. Tracking unit for a solar collector comprising at least one frame with at least two panels which can each be pivoted about a pivoting axis, with the positions of the pivoting axes of adjacent panels being displaced by a distance .DELTA.x in relation to a central axis of the panels. 2. Tracking unit according to claim 1, wherein the pivoting axes of the panels are arranged on the frame in one plane. 3. Tracking unit according to claim 1, wherein a plurality of panels can be pivoted at the same angle by means of a mechanical drive. 4. Tracking unit according to claim 1, wherein the frame is mounted rotatably on a guide ring mounted rigidly on a mounting surface. 5. Tracking unit according to claim 4, wherein the guide ring is provided with a first bearing surface and an internal bearing surface which is arranged at an angle of less than 90.degree. with respect to the first bearing surface. 6. Tracking unit according to claim 5, wherein a first roller runs on the first bearing surface and an internal roller runs on the internal bearing surface, which are braced against each other. 7. Tracking unit according to claim 1, wherein a device for passive fine adjustment of at least one light collector arranged on one panel is provided, and the device is configured for alignment of at least one light collector to the sun by means of thermal expansion of a material that expands in response to heat.
