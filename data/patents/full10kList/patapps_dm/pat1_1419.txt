An improved building panel and attachment system for the production of structures with improved energy efficiency and fire safety characteristics. Panels are formed from a structural angle I beam with angles emerging from a web and forming dovetail shaped channels. The dovetail channels provide anchorage points for cross members within the panels as well as weather-stripping and mechanical joints between panels and a building frame. The unique assembly method allows the insulation value and fire safety of the building to be radically improved over conventional commercial structures. Fiberglass can be combined with low thermal conductivity gases such as Argon to improve R-Values by about 40% over existing building stock. Heat and smoke can be vented from the building during a fire to slow the onset of flashover and the safety of fire fighting personnel can be enhanced when they reach the fire scene. Improved insulating panels, daylighting panels with light attenuation and heat dissipation means, as well as solar panels for solar heating and night sky cooling are shown. These can be assembled into a variety of functional roof and wall configurations for reducing building operating costs and creating more attractive retail and commercial buildings. Improved air distribution systems, and thin film collectors allow for production of an entire roof of collectors at a reasonable cost. Novel assembly methods allow for improvements in construction cost and safety. An advanced control system for balancing daylighting and artificial lighting is shown, along with a demand side management, (DSM), energy utilization system.
