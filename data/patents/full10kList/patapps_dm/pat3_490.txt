A system and method for an integrated rechargeable power system for a container monitoring and security system is provided. The power system is affixed to a container and comprises an integrated photovoltaic area conforming to the container construction, a battery pack module, power conditioning circuitry or recharge unit, and a power controller unit. The photovoltaic unit may be conventional photovoltaic crystalline cell array, or a photovoltaic coating with is applied to the walls, door, or roof of a container.
Claims 1. A method for providing an integrated rechargeable power system for providing long term power for monitoring a shipping container having horizontal, vertical, and/or angular elements which include raised surfaces and recessed surfaces, wherein the method comprises: applying a dielectric layer directly onto a recessed surface of the shipping container; spraying a liquidized photovoltaic element onto the surface of the dielectric layer; providing a battery element; and electrically connecting the photovoltaic element to the battery element for storing electrical energy. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the photovoltaic element is comprised of a spray coating of a Copper Indium Diselenide. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the photovoltaic element is comprised of a spray coating of a Cadmium Telluride.
