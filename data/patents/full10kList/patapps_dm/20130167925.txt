The invention relates to a mounting system, which is configured for mounting at least one photovoltaic module (20) and a solar collector (30) on a substructure suitable therefor. The mounting system (1) comprises at least one U-shaped mounting carrier (2) for fastening the at least one photovoltaic module (20) and for accommodating at least one solar collector (30), the U-shaped mounting support being fastened to the substructure by means of a mounting rail (3), wherein the mounting carrier (2) has support clamping receptacles (9) for fastening the at least one photovoltaic module (20) to at least one of the outer surfaces of the mounting carrier. The mounting system further comprises the at least one solar collector (30), which is accommodated in the interior of the at least one mounting carrier (2), at least one module support (11), which locks into a support clamping receptacle (9) on the mounting carrier (2), at least one module clamp (10), between which the at least one photovoltaic module (20) is fixed on the mounting carrier (2) by means of a fastening element (12), and a cover (8) for the mounting carrier (2).
Claims 1. Mounting system for mounting at least one photovoltaic module and one solar collector on a substructure, the mounting system comprising: a) at least one U-shaped mounting carrier attached to the substructure via a mounting rail, for attaching the at least one photovoltaic module and for receiving at least one solar collector, the mounting carrier having support clamp receptacles for fastening the at least one photovoltaic module on at least one of its external surfaces; b) the at least one solar collector that is received on the inside of the at least one mounting carrier; c) at least one module support that locks into a support clamp receptacle on the mounting carrier, and at least one module clamp, between which the at least one photovoltaic module is attached to the mounting carrier using a fastening element; and d) a cover for the mounting carrier. 2. Mounting system according to claim 1, in which the support clamp receptacles are provided at different heights on the at least one external surface of the mounting carrier, so that photovoltaic modules of different thickness can be attached. 3. Converter device with at least one photovoltaic module and at least one solar collector, which are mounted using a mounting system, said mounting system comprising: a) at least one U-shaped mounting carrier attached to the substructure via a mounting rail, for attaching the at least one photovoltaic module and for receiving at least one solar collector, the mounting carrier having support clamp receptacles for fastening the at least one photovoltaic module on at least one of its external surfaces; b) the at least one solar collector that is received on the inside of the at least one mounting carrier; c) at least one module support that locks into a support clamp receptacle on the mounting carrier, and at least one module clamp, between which the at least one photovoltaic module is attached to the mounting carrier using a fastening element; and d) a cover for the mounting carrier. 4. Method for mounting at least one photovoltaic module and at least one solar collector, comprising: a) attaching a U-shaped mounting carrier, which has on its external surface support clamp receptacles and in its interior the at least one solar collector, to a substructure by means of a mounting rail; b) covering the at least one solar collector and the mounting carrier by a transparent cover; c) positioning the at least one photovoltaic module between a module support, which locks into one of the clamp receptacles on the mounting carrier, and a module clamp, which partially overlaps the at least one photovoltaic module, the at least one solar collector and the cover (8), the module support and the module clamp being connected by a fastening element; and d) attaching the at least one photovoltaic module by appropriate actuation of the fastening element.
