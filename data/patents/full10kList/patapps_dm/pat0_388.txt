The invention relates to a DC/AC conversion structure, preferably intended for photovoltaic systems, having a high yield across the entire input voltage range thereof, thereby guaranteeing that direct current is not injected into the alternating current network. In a preferred embodiment, the circuit includes six switching elements (T1 to T6) controlled by a command unit. In addition, the circuit includes a capacitive divider (C4 and C5) having the negative of the photovoltaic field connected to one of the ends thereof and a network terminal connected at the mid-point of same, which minimises problems of electromagnetic compatibility.
