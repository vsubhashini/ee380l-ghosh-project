A system and method that offers the provision too rapidly and safely connect electrical generation sources, including inverters used by solar collecting panels, or wind turbines, and backup hydrocarbon fueled generators or any other supplemental power sources including storage batteries, fuel cells and future electric automobiles. Thus enabling the feeding of power to all circuits in the home or small business, not just isolated circuits in a structure. The system is compliant with electric codes, requires no costly rewiring inside the structure or in the electrical circuit panel and can be accomplished entirely from the outside of the home or small business adjacent to the electric service meter for the home or small business structure. It offers owners, utilities and equipment manufacturers a simple, safe, cost effective method for interconnection of renewable generation and storage devices with the electric grid for participation in smart energy management and net metering initiatives with local utility companies.
Claims 1. An electrical power transfer plug and connection system for lowering the cost of installation of a grid-tied inverter/controller for solar collectors, wind turbine generators, back-up generators or any other supplemental power source or energy system that could be used to power your home or small business, comprising: 1.1 a 200 amp #2 gage copper wires, all weather flexible conduit system wire harness, for transferring the electricity flow to and from the existing meter junction box into the auxiliary meter junction box and then back again to the house service panel through the existing meter junction box; 1.2 a plug that plugs into the existing meter socket, transfers power from existing meter junction box through the wire harness to auxiliary meter junction box, for diverting the electrical power from existing service to new auxiliary meter junction box and load management center with inputs for alternative energy systems; 1.3 a common line common wire, for transferring power, rigidly connected to said system wire harness; 1.3 a # 2 copper wire power leg one wire in, for power coming from the power utility through the power transfer plug into the auxiliary meter junction box from power leg one, rigidly connected to said system wire harness; 1.4 a # 2 copper wire power leg two wire in, for power coming from the power utility through the power transfer plug into the auxiliary meter junction box from power leg two, rigidly connected to said system wire harness; 1.5 a # 2 copper power leg one wire out, for return the power back of leg one to the existing meter junction box and on into the main service panel, rigidly connected to said system wire harness; 1.6 a # 2 copper wire power leg two wire out, for return the power of leg two back to the existing meter junction box and on into the main service panel, rigidly connected to said system wire harness; 1.7 a non-conductive plastic injected molded part with alignment guide blocks, for guiding the meter jumper plug into correct alignment during an installation; 1.8 a copper cast part with zinc plating for the common wire block, for clamping the common wire from the meter junction box to the common transfer strap for facilitating transferring the common wire from the meter junction box to the auxiliary meter junction box and load management center; 1.9 a copper strap that is zinc coated, common transfer strap, for facilitating transferring the common wire from the meter receiver box to the auxiliary meter junction box and load management center, rigidly connected to said common wire block; 1.10 a copper screw that is zinc coated common strap screw, for connecting the common transfer strap to the common block for facilitating transferring the common wire from the existing meter junction box to the auxiliary meter junction box and load management center; 1.11 a copper zinc plated common block clamp, for clamping the ground wire from the meter receiver box to the ground transfer strap for facilitating transferring the ground wire from the meter receiver box to the system meter socket; 1.12 a non-conductive plastic injection molded power transfer plug base, for creating the base for which all other elements of the meter jumper plug are mounted too, rigidly connected to said common transfer strap, and rigidly connected to said alignment guide blocks; 1.13 a cast copper, zinc coated power blade & block, for facilitating within the meter transfer plug in transferring the electric current to and from the meter junction box and to and from the auxiliary meter junction box and load management center; 1.14 a zinc coated metal cover screw, for securing the meter plug cover to the plug base; 1.15 a non-conducting plastic injection molded part power transfer plug cover, for creating a weather tight seal and cover over the components of the power transfer plug, rigidly connected to said base component with cover screw; 1.16 a copper, zinc coated power blade & block screw, for securing the wire in the power blade & block within the meter transfer plug, facilitating transferring the electric current to and from the meter junction box to and from the auxiliary meter junction box and load management center, rigidly connected to said power blade & block; 1.17 a copper, zinc coated common block, for creating a connection point within the meter transfer plug for the custom wire harness to facilitating transferring the common wire from the meter junction box to the auxiliary meter junction box and load management center, rigidly connected to said common strap screw; 1.18 a copper, zinc coated common block screw, for securing the connection point within the meter transfer plug for the custom wire harness to facilitating transferring the common wire from the meter junction box to the auxiliary meter junction box and load management center, rigidly connected to said power transfer plug cover, and rigidly connected to said common wire block; 1.19 a non-conductive plastic injection molded part, power blain & block seat, for creating a secure mounting position for the power blade & block elements, rigidly connected to said power transfer plug base, and rigidly connected to said common block clamp; and 1.20 a non-conductive plastic injection molded part common block seat, for creating a secure mounting position for the common block element, rigidly connected to said common block, and rigidly connected to said power transfer plug base.
