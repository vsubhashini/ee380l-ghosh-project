A personal discovery of the numerous performance advantages that will result from the integration of entitled "Limacon of Pascal" planar curve properties inspired the present inventor to begin materializing an extremely efficient means of capturing and processing fluid stream energy. As the development of a new technology progressed the unique traits and properties of additional planar curves, both named and untitled, became evident and viable.
