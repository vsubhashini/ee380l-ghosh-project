A connection device for photovoltaic panels and related devices providing for the electrical, or other, interconnection of photovoltaic panels and related devices to other devices through structural and non-structural stanchions that act in an additional capacity as conduit.
Claims 1. A mounting stanchion for the mounting of photovoltaic panels that is comprised of a hollow element that is a structural component for the overall purpose of mounting and whose terminal ends may be used for the transit of wires, cables or tubes from photovoltaic panel through stanchion and to other devices; 2. A mounting stanchion for the mounting of photovoltaic panels and that is comprised of a hollow element that is a structural component for the overall purpose of mounting and that contains holes, cuts, notches or slits through the wall of the hollow vertical element and whose purpose of those holes is not mounting; 3. A mounting stanchion for the mounting of photovoltaic panels where such mounting is manifested through a mounting surface and where mounting stanchion is comprised of a hollow element that is a structural component for the overall purpose of mounting and whose terminal ends may be used for the transit of wires, cables or tubes from photovoltaic panel through stanchion and to other devices; 4. A mounting stanchion for the mounting of photovoltaic panels where such mounting is manifested through a mounting surface and where mounting stanchion is comprised of a hollow element that is a structural component for the overall purpose of mounting and that contains holes, cuts, notches or slits through the wall of the hollow vertical element and whose purpose of those holes is not mounting.
