An electrical connector/cable harness includes an electrically insulative housing and first and second passageways extending from a first end of the connector/cable harness to a second end thereof, first and second electrically conductive wires disposed in the passageways, respectively, wherein the passageways and the wires therein reverse their dispositions in the connector/cable harness such that at the second end of the connector/cable harness the two wires are disposed oppositely to their disposition at the first end of the connector/cable harness.
Claims 1. An alternating current (AC) module assembly comprising: a first AC module comprising a photovoltaic cell and an inverter for providing a single phase AC output to a first wiring harness; a second AC module comprising a photovoltaic cell and an inverter for providing a single phase AC output to a second wiring harness; a third AC module comprising a photovoltaic cell and an inverter for providing a single phase AC output to a third wiring harness; a first junction box coupled to the first wiring harness to receive the AC output of the first series of AC modules; a second junction box coupled to the second wiring harness to receive the AC output of the second series of AC modules; a third junction box coupled to the third wiring harness to receive the AC output of the third series of AC modules; and a service panel in electrical communication with the first junction box, the second junction box, and the third junction box to provide a three phase AC output.
