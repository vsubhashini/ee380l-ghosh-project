An automatic monitoring and alarming device based on large strain of a power transmission tower comprises a solar cell (7), a wireless alarm sending device (6), an insulation basement (5) and a truss with great probability of generating large strain on the power transmission tower. One end of two invar alloy fine rods is respectively fixed on the insulation basement (5). The first invar alloy fine rod (1A) is fixedly adhered to the truss with great probability of generating large strain on the power transmission tower, and the arrangement direction of which is the same as the strain generating direction of the truss. The second invar alloy fine rod (1B) is sleeved with an insulation bushing (4) and is suspended on the outside of the truss with great probability of generating large strain. The solar cell (7), the wireless alarm sending device (6), a metal probe (2) and a metal contact (3) together form an alarm circuit. The strain of the service power transmission tower is automatically monitored and alarmed by the automatic monitoring and alarming device, which solves the problem that the large strain of the power transmission tower body can not be detected in time in the prior art.
