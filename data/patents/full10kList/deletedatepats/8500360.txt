A traffic cone system for deploying a banner of flat traffic cones featuring a base spool pivotally anchored in the inner cavity of a utility vehicle and a deployment spool. A banner of flat traffic cones is wound around the base spool and is connected to the deployment spool. The deployment spool is mounted above an extension shaft and a ground base. The ground base can be anchored to the ground surface. The extension shaft can position the deployment spool at an appropriate height. The banner can be unwound from the base spool to display a plurality of flat triangle cones resembling traffic cones.
