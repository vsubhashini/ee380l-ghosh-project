The disclosed invention is a solar tracker that is a simple 2 axis system that can be powered with integrated stepping motors and lead screw actuators that provides the necessary structural support and 2 degrees of freedom in the motion of the solar collector, to increase the electrical output of the system. Since the solution is designed for use with only one solar panel the mechanical forces such as wind load are much lower and easier to manage. The disclosed invention is also a solar tracker that is a single axis version where the base is fixed and the elevation is set at an average value for the location and pivoting mechanism operates the azimuth axis. Since the dominant energy improvement comes from tracking the azimuth, this would be a likely solution where a lower cost or less complex system is desired.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar tracker for a solar panel, comprising: a subframe having a solar panel mounted thereon; a base frame having said subframe mounted thereon, said subframe having a limited range of motion in elevation relative to said base frame corresponding to a maximum winter solar angle for an installation location; a first stepping motor, a corresponding first lead screw mounted between said subframe and said base frame disposed for movement of said subframe in azimuth relative to said base frame; a second stepping motor, a corresponding second lead screw mounted between said subframe and said base frame disposed for movement of said subframe in elevation relative to said base frame; and wherein said mounting of said subframe on said base frame, said second stepping motor and said corresponding second lead screw reduces the total range of motion required for seasonal adjustment. 2. A solar tracker for a solar panel, comprising: a subframe having a solar panel mounted thereon; a base frame; a first stepping motor, a corresponding first lead screw mounted between said subframe and said base frame disposed for movement of said subframe in azimuth relative to said base frame; a second stepping motor, a corresponding second lead screw mounted between said subframe and said base frame disposed for movement of said subframe in elevation relative to said base frame; a read only memory (ROM) storing data tables regarding solar azimuth and elevation verses time for an installation location; and a electronic controller connected to said first stepping motor, said second stepping motor and said read only memory, said electronic controller consulting said data tables stored in said read only memory and controlling said first stepping motor and said second stepping motor to cause said solar panel to orient to solar azimuth and elevation according to a current time to thereby track daily sun movement. 3. A solar tracker for a solar panel, comprising: a subframe having a solar panel mounted thereon; a base frame, said subframe mounted on said base frame at a fixed elevation corresponding to an average solar elevation for an installation location; and a stepping motor, a corresponding lead screw and a first tie rod mounted between said subframe and said base frame disposed for movement of said subframe in azimuth relative to said base frame; a read only memory (ROM) storing data tables regarding solar azimuth verses time for an installation location; and a electronic controller connected to said stepping motor, said electronic controller consulting said data tables stored in said read only memory and controlling said stepping motor to cause said solar panel to orient to solar azimuth according to a current time to thereby track daily solar movement.
