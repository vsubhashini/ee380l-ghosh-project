A wireless monitoring camera device includes a CMOS image sensor adapted to receive a video signal through photographing, a video signal processor adapted to convert the video signal received from the image sensor into a JPEG or MPEG file, a transmit unit adapted to transmit the converted video signal received from the video signal processor to a receive unit connected to an external storage unit in a wireless manner, a power supply unit adapted to supply driving power to the image sensor, the video signal processor and the transmit unit, a solar cell adapted to receive light emitted output from the sun or a lighting to generate photoelectromotive force x, and a power supply controller adapted to convert the photoelectromotive force generated from the solar cell so that the photoelectromotive force can be used as driving power by the power supply unit.
Claims 1. A wireless monitoring camera device, comprising: a CMOS image sensor adapted to receive a video signal through photographing; a video signal processor adapted to convert the video signal received from the image sensor into a JPEG or MPEG file; a transmit unit adapted to transmit the converted video signal received from the video signal processor to a receive unit connected to an external storage unit in a wireless manner; and a power supply unit adapted to supply driving power to the image sensor, the video signal processor and the transmit unit. 2. The wireless monitoring camera device as claimed in claim 1, further including: a solar cell adapted to receive light emitted output from the sun or a lighting to generate photoelectromotive force; and a power supply controller adapted to convert the photoelectromotive force generated from the solar cell so that the photoelectromotive force can be used as driving power by the power supply unit. 3. The wireless monitoring camera device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the transmit unit includes a wireless system on a chip, and transmits the video signal using an Ultra Wide Band (UWB) wireless technology.
