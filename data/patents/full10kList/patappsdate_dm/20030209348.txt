An oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. Heat may be provided to a portion of the formation from one or more heat sources. Heat may be allowed to transfer from the heat sources to a selection of the formation. Hydrocarbons, H.sub.2, and/or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation. A recovery fluid may be provided to the formation to recover one or more components remaining in the portion.
