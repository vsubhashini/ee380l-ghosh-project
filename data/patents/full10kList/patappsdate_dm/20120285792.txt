The method of claim 1 wherein the outer meter housing includes a front face and a preexisting opening through the front face through which a payment device of the existing meter extends, wherein both the credit card slot and the money slot are accessible through the preexisting opening following the inserting and closing steps. 5. The method of claim 1 wherein the new meter mechanism further includes a keypad and a support structure extending outward from the front side of the inner housing, the support structure supporting both the credit card mag-strip reader and the keypad, wherein the support structure is sized to fit through the preexisting opening following the inserting and closing steps. 6. The method of claim 1 wherein the new meter mechanism further includes a solar panel supported by the internal housing, wherein the new meter mechanism is inserted into the outer housing such that the solar panel is located within the outer housing and is exposed to light passing through the window. 7. The method of claim 1 further comprising: providing a vehicle sensor configured to detect a vehicle located within a parking space associated with the parking meter; coupling the vehicle sensor to a support pole supporting the outer housing; and electronically coupling the vehicle sensor to the electronic control system. 8. The method of claim 7 wherein the vehicle sensor is coupled to the support pole between the ground and the outer meter housing, wherein the vehicle sensor is coupled to the support pole before the new meter mechanism is inserted in to the outer housing. 9. The method of claim 1 wherein the outer meter housing includes a cap supporting the window and a lower housing portion coupled to a support pole, wherein the cap is joined to the lower housing portion by a hinge. 10. A method of modifying a single space parking meter including an outer housing, a payment device opening formed in a front surface of the outer housing and an existing meter mechanism having a payment device extending through the payment device opening, the method comprising: delivering a new meter mechanism to a recipient, the new meter mechanism comprising: an inner housing including a front side and a rear side; an integrated payment and user interface structure extending outward from the front side of the inner housing, the integrated payment and user interface structure supporting a credit card mag-strip reader and a keypad; an electronic control system supported by the inner housing and controlling operation of the credit card mag-strip reader and the keypad; wherein the recipient of the mechanism: opens the outer meter housing; removes the existing meter mechanism from the outer meter housing including removing the payment device of the existing meter mechanism from the payment device opening, wherein the existing meter mechanism does not include a credit card mag-strip reader; mounts the new meter mechanism within the outer meter housing such that the integrated payment and user interface structure extends through the payment device opening; and closes the outer meter housing around the new meter mechanism. 11. The method of claim 10 wherein the integrated payment and user interface structure fits through the payment device opening of the outer housing without expanding the payment opening. 12. The method of claim 10 wherein the integrated payment and user interface structure extends a distance outward from a front face of the outer housing. 13. The method of claim 10 wherein the new meter mechanism further comprises a gap formed between a rear surface of the integrated payment and user interface structure and the front side of the inner housing. 14. The method of claim 13 wherein the mounting step comprises receiving a portion of the outer housing below the payment device opening within the gap. 15. The method of claim 14 wherein the rear surface of the payment structure abuts the front surface of the outer meter housing. 16. The method of claim 10 wherein the new meter mechanism further comprises wireless communications hardware supported by the inner housing configured to wirelessly communicate with a parking management system. 17. The method of claim 16 further comprising: providing a vehicle sensor configured to detect a vehicle located within a parking space associated with the single space parking meter; coupling the vehicle sensor to a support pole supporting the outer housing; and electronically coupling the vehicle sensor to the electronic control system, wherein the electronic control system is configured to communicate data from the vehicle sensor to the parking management system via the wireless communications hardware. 18. A method of upgrading a single space parking meter that includes an existing meter mechanism located within an outer meter housing, comprising: providing a new meter mechanism comprising: an inner housing including a front side and a rear side; wireless communications hardware supported by the inner housing configured to wirelessly communicate with a parking management system; a solar panel supported by the inner housing; a currency reader including a money slot for receiving currency; an electronic display screen supported by the inner housing; and an electronic control system supported by the inner housing and controlling operation of the wireless communications hardware, the currency reader and the electronic display screen; opening the outer meter housing, the outer meter housing defining a preexisting internal space and including a preexisting window; removing the existing meter mechanism from the outer meter housing; inserting the new meter mechanism into the preexisting internal space of the outer meter housing; and closing the outer meter housing around the new meter mechanism, wherein the electronic display screen is viewable through the preexisting window following closing, the solar panel is located within the outer housing and is exposed to light passing through the preexisting window, wherein the preexisting window is in substantially the same location following closing as it was before opening. 19. The method of claim 18 wherein the alteration of the structure of the outer meter housing is not required for the new electronic meter mechanism to fit within the outer meter housing. 20. The method of claim 18 wherein the solar panel extends from the inner housing at position directly below the electronic display. 21. The method of claim 18 wherein the new meter mechanism includes a keypad, and further wherein the keypad is positioned less than 48 inches from the ground once inserted in the outer meter housing. 22. The method of claim 21 wherein the keypad includes markings and the keypad markings are visible from a viewing position that is at least 18 inches from a front surface of the outer meter housing and that is less than or equal to 39 inches above the ground. 23. The method of claim 21 wherein the keypad includes markings and the keypad markings are visible from a viewing position that is at least 42 inches from a front surface of the outer meter housing and that is less than or equal to 39 inches above the ground. 24. The method of claim 18 wherein the electronic display screen includes a field of view volume that is defined by points at which either the brightness or contrast of the electronic display screen reduces to 25% of the original value as measured at the most optimal viewing angle, and wherein a point that is 18 inches from a front surface of the outer meter housing and that is 39 inches above the ground is within the field of view volume. 25. The method of claim 18 wherein the electronic display screen includes a field of view volume that is defined by points at which either the brightness or contrast of the electronic display screen reduces to 25% of the original value as measured at the most optimal viewing angle, and wherein a point that is 42 inches from a front surface of the outer meter housing and that is 39 inches above the ground is within the field of view volume.
