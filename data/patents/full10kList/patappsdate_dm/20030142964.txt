An oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. A mixture of hydrocarbons, H.sub.2, and/or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Heat may be applied to the formation to raise a temperature of a portion of the formation to a desited temperature. A heating rate for a selected volume of the formation may be controlled by altering an amount of heating energy per day that is provided to the selected volume.
