Multiple brackets are used together to support photovoltaic cells upon a roof. Each bracket includes a mounting rail at an upper side and a bottom rail at a lower side. The bottom rail of one bracket is configured to overlap the mounting rail of another bracket. Lateral joints on each bracket overlap each other to connect adjacent panels of photovoltaic cells. Cell support structures are interposed between the mounting rail and bottom rail to support a photovoltaic stack assembly thereon. Wind clips allow the bottom rail of a higher bracket to be interconnected with a mounting rail of a lower bracket. An undulating end piece allows airflow to enter beneath a lowest bracket and pass up beneath the brackets to provide cooling air for the overall system of photovoltaic cells mounted upon the brackets. Edge flashing precludes water migration laterally at edges of the panels.
