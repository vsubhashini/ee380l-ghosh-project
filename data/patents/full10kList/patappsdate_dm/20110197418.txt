Mounting system of solar panels (both photovoltaic and solar water heating) using cables and anchored to the sides of the building or to ground mounts is described. The mounting method does not require roof penetrations, minimizing potential for water leaks associated with roof penetrations. The mounting system allows for the panels to be mounted at different heights over the surface of the roof.
Claims 1. Solar Panel mounting method utilizing steel cables and not requiring roof penetrations or ballast. 2. A Solar Panel mounting method according to claim 1, wherein, steel cables are anchored through building wall or to ground mounts. 3. A Solar Panel mounting method according to claim 1, which allows provides a secondary roof canopy over the roof consisting of solar panels, and which allows continued access for construction and maintenance of the water barrier roof surface. 4. A Solar Panel mounting method according to claim 1, where panels can be oriented along any required solar azimuth. 5. A Solar Panel mounting method that maximizes the ratio between insolation surface area and ground-connected structures. 6. A solar panel mounting method according to claim 5 that can be deployed over any large surface area without impinging on its access or use.
