An arrangement with a photovoltaic generator is provided that can be connected to the input of a power inverter, the output of which is connected to a supply network. The arrangement further comprises an asynchronous machine parallel to the output of the power inverter, which asynchronous machine is driven by an internal combustion engine.
Claims 1. An arrangement comprising: a photovoltaic generator that is connectable to an input of a power inverter, an output of the power inverter being connectable to a supply network; and an asynchronous machine configured to be driven by an internal combustion engine, the asynchronous machine being connectable in parallel to the output of the power inverter. 2. The arrangement according to claim 1, wherein a battery is connectable in parallel to the input of the power inverter. 3. The arrangement according to claim 1, wherein a power network infeed takes place on the part of the photovoltaic generator and the asynchronous machine at a preselectable cos phi and/or a predetermined power. 4. The arrangement according to claim 3, wherein in sum a power infeed on the part of the photovoltaic generator and the asynchronous machine takes place at a cos phi in the amount of 0.99 to 1. 5. The arrangement according to claim 1, wherein, with the asynchronous machine switched off, the power inverter is connectable to the supply network at a predetermined cos phi and draws reactive power therefrom or feeds reactive power into it. 6. The arrangement according to claim 3, wherein a logic and control unit which based on an instruction signal controls a power of the combustion engine and adjusts the cos phi of the power inverter. 7. The arrangement according to claim 6, wherein actual values of a fed current and of the prevailing mains voltage are supplied from a measuring point in the supply network to the logic and control unit in order to regulate it via desired values contained in the instruction signal.
