A oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. A mixture of hydrocarbons, H.sub.2, and/or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Heat may be applied to the formation to raise a temperature of a portion of the formation to a pyrolysis temperature. Heat sources may be used to heat the formation. The heat sources may be positioned within the formation in a selected pattern.
