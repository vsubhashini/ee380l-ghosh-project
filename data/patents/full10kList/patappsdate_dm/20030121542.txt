Known methods of producing large-surface integrated thin-film solar modules with an amorphous, poly- or microcrystalline absorber layer always comprise division and conversion structuring processes which can cause instabilities in the structuring and which are relatively expensive. According to the inventive method which can be used to fabricate substrate solar cells (116) and superstrate solar cells, the mask (100) which is used provides for structuring itself during the deposition of layers for the rear electrode (106) and the absorber layer (11) through its geometrical form. The use of a mask (110) which can be reused as an independent element after use in this method allows for a relatively free range of possible geometric forms. This also makes possible applications inside and outside of buildings, including in the area of a window, from an esthetic and informal point of view. These types of application are also supported by the possibility of a structural connection between the solar modules produced according to the inventive method and light-collecting concentrator modules, in order considerably to increase their average and total energy conversion efficiency.
