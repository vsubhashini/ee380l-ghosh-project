The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the housing top (3) has means for connecting external wiring (11). 3. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the housing base (2) further comprises a mounting pedestal (2) and/or means for effective connection with a mounting pedestal (2). 4. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the retaining means (21) of the housing top (3) for receiving the circuit board (20) comprises a support (22), a relief cut (23) and/or snap elements (24). 5. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the circuit board (20) generally extends across the entire opening of the housing top (3). 6. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 5, wherein the circuit board is disposed between the housing base (2) and the housing top (3). 7. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein a seal (8) is disposed between the circuit board (20) and the housing top (3) and/or the housing base (2). 8. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the housing top (3) and the circuit board (20) form a modular unit. 9. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the circuit board (20) has electrical/electronic components (28). 10. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 9 and further connected with a solar cell, wherein the electrical/electronic components (28) are mounted on the side of the circuit board (20) which is turned away from the solar cell (33). 11. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 8, wherein the electrical/electronic components (28) are in the an interior area (31) of the housing top (3). 12. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the housing base (2) has an opening (16) for receiving electrical connectors (35) of a solar cell (33). 13. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 12, wherein the opening (16) is fitted in the a housing bottom (18) of the housing base. 14. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the circuit board (20) interacts with the housing base (2) through first and second electrical contacts (25, 26), which make an effective connection with the housing base (2) when the housing top (3) is closed. 15. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the housing top (3) has cooling openings (30). 16. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the circuit board (20) is designed as a thermal separation element. 17. A connection box (1) for use with a solar cell comprising: a housing base (2) and a housing top (3) wherein the housing top (3) has retaining means (21) for receiving a circuit board (20) and at least one of the housing base (2) and the housing top (3) has an opening (16) for receiving electrical connectors (35) of the solar cell (33). 18. The connection box (1) as claimed in claim 17, wherein the circuit board (20) interacts with the housing base (2) through first and second electrical contacts (25, 26), which make an effective connection with the housing base (2) when the housing top (3) is closed.
