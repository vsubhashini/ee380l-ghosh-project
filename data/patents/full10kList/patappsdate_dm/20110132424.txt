A system and method to optimize the overall power output of a photovoltaic solar array. The solar panels are connected to software adjustable power optimizing devices, which in turn are connected to a mesh network with individual router devices. The individual router devices will send and receive data packets by creating or detecting vibrations in a solid vibration conducting media (such as the solar power wiring) that connects the individual photovoltaic solar panels. Often at least one centralized control device is used to periodically request sensor data packets from the individual router devices and solar panels. The centralized control device will typically compute the proper adjustments for the individual adjustable power optimizing devices that will optimize the overall power output from the photovoltaic solar array. The control device will then send adjustment data packets back to the individual router devices through the mesh network, thus optimizing overall power output.
