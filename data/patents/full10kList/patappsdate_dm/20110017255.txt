A device that uses specific dominant wavelength light emitting diode to excite the electrons in photovoltaic cells to produce DC voltage for the purposes of: (a) providing DC voltage to its own light emitting diode system and (b) providing external voltage for an application that requires voltage to operate.
Claims 1. This invention is an enclosed device that uses few to many parts to produce DC electrical voltage from photovoltaic cells and light emitting diode. 2. This device is configured to be self powered once an initial "start up" external voltage source is applied. 3. This device will produce DC voltage for applications needing an external DC voltage source 4. The device can be used with an inverter to convert DC voltage to AC voltage
