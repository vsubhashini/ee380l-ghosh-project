There is provided a power conversion system, and a photovoltaic inverter includes a communication unit that broadcast-transmits a setting request signal of a predetermined communication address. The photovoltaic inverter includes a display unit that displays the predetermined communication address indicated by the setting request signal, and an address setting unit that generates a setting completion signal indicating that the predetermined communication address has been set as the communication address of the photovoltaic inverter if an input accepting unit accepts an input such that the predetermined communication address is set. An address management unit of the photovoltaic inverter generates a setting request signal indicating a communication address other than the predetermined communication address if the setting completion signal for the predetermined communication address is received.
Claims 1. A power conversion system including a plurality of photovoltaic inverters connected to a power-generating device and an address setting device that sets communication addresses of the photovoltaic inverters, the address setting device comprising: an address management unit that generates a setting request signal of a predetermined communication address; and a transmitting unit that broadcast-transmits the setting request signal generated by the address management unit, the photovoltaic inverter comprising: a receiving unit that receives the setting request signal; a display unit that displays the predetermined communication address indicated by the setting request signal; an input accepting unit that accepts, from a setting person, an input such that the predetermined communication address is set; a storing unit that stores the predetermined communication address as a communication address of the said photovoltaic inverter if the input accepting unit accepts the input such that the predetermined communication address is set; a communication address setting unit that generates a setting completion signal indicating that the predetermined communication address has been set as the communication address of the said photovoltaic inverter; and a transmitting unit that transmits the setting completion signal generated by the communication address setting unit to the address setting device, wherein the address setting device further comprises a receiving unit that receives the setting completion signal, and the address management unit of the address setting device generates the setting request signal indicating a communication address other than the predetermined communication address if the receiving unit of the address setting device receives the setting completion signal for the predetermined communication address. 2. The power conversion system according to claim 1, wherein when the receiving unit receives the setting request signal, the display unit of the photovoltaic inverter does not display the communication address indicated by the setting request signal received by the receiving unit if the communication address of the said photovoltaic inverter has already been stored in the storing unit. 3. The power conversion system according to claim 2, wherein when the receiving unit receives the setting request signal, the display unit of the photovoltaic inverter displays the communication address of the said power conditioner photovoltaic inverter if the communication address of the said photovoltaic inverter has already been stored in the storing unit. 4. A communication address setting method in a system including a plurality of photovoltaic inverters connected to a power-generating device and an address setting device that sets communication addresses of the photovoltaic inverters, the method comprising: a generating step of generating a setting request signal of a predetermined communication address by an address management unit of the address setting device; a transmitting step of broadcast-transmitting the setting request signal generated in the generating step by a transmitting unit of the address setting device; a receiving step of receiving the setting request signal by a receiving unit of the photovoltaic inverter; a displaying step of displaying the predetermined communication address indicated by the setting request signal by a display unit of the photovoltaic inverter; an input accepting step of accepting, from a setting person, an input such that the predetermined communication address is set by an input accepting unit of the photovoltaic inverter; a storing step of storing, by a communication address setting unit of the photovoltaic inverter, the predetermined communication address as a communication address of the said photovoltaic inverter in a storing unit if the input such that the predetermined communication address is set is accepted in the input accepting step; a communication address setting step of generating, by the communication address setting unit of the photovoltaic inverter, a setting completion signal indicating that the predetermined communication address has been set as the communication address of the said photovoltaic inverter; a transmitting step of transmitting the setting completion signal generated in the communication address setting step to the address setting device by a transmitting unit of the photovoltaic inverter; and a receiving step of receiving the setting completion signal by a receiving unit of the address setting device, wherein in the generating step, the setting request signal indicating a communication address other than the predetermined communication address is generated if the setting completion signal for the predetermined communication address is received in the receiving step.
