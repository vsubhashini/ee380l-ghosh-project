Multi-Mission Frameless Airship Platform (MFAP) leverages composite material science to achieve a frameless lightweight airframe design enabling increased speed, lift and cargo capacity. Deployable/retrievable high-value modules provide enhanced operational and mission flexibility. Unified power electronics enable hybrid integration of propulsion, power generation (e.g. diesel generator, photovoltaic solar, etc.), energy storage and tethered wind-power generation for both on-grid and off-grid electrical power delivery for airborne operations and ground operations. Onboard antenna systems serve as cell phone towers.
