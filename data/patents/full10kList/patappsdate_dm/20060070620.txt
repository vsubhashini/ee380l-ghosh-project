A self regulating system and method for heating a swimming pool, using solar energy. There is a cover member which is placed over the surface of the swimming pool and water from the swimming pool is pumped cyclically through flow paths in the cover section. Solar energy directed to the top surface of the cover section heats the water that flows through the cover section. There is a solar power pumping and control system by which solar energy is utilized to supply electrical energy to a battery and also to a motor of a pump. A control section causes the cyclical operation of the pump so that the pumping cycles are related to the intensity of the solar energy which is being transmitted to the system at that time.
