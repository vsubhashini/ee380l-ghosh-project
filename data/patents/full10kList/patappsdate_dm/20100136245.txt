The present invention provides a method to design, manufacture and structure a multi-component energy device having a unified structure, wherein the individual components are chosen from the list consisting of electrochemical cells, photovoltaic cells, fuel-cells, capacitors, ultracapacitors, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, microelectromechanical turbines and energy scavengers. Said components are organized into a structure to achieve an energy density, power density, voltage range, current range and lifetime range that the single components could not achieve individually, i.e. to say the individual components complement each other. The individual components form a hybrid structure, wherein the elements are in electrical, chemical and thermal conduction with each other. The electrochemical cells present multiple chemistries to accommodate a wider range of voltage and current compared to individual ones; energy-scavenging elements are utilized to collect energy and replenish it to other components within the unified structure.
