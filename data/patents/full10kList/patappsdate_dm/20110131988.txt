Increasing power generation efficiency of a solar-fossil-fuel-hybrid power plant includes heating working fluid with a concentrating solar field by directing a first portion of a steam turbine drive working fluid from an economizer of a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant into a concentrated solar power ("CSP") field where the first portion of the steam turbine drive working fluid is heated to a predefined temperature and pressure above that which is in a CSP inlet to the steam boiler while a second portion of the steam turbine drive working fluid is directed from the economizer to a steam boiler and the first portion of the steam turbine drive working fluid is combined with the second portion of the working fluid at the inlet.
Claims 1. A method of increasing power generation efficiency of a solar-fossil-fuel-hybrid power plant, the method comprising: directing a first portion of a steam turbine drive working fluid from an economizer of a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant into a concentrated solar power ("CSP") field; directing a second portion of the steam turbine drive working fluid from the economizer to a steam boiler; causing the CSP field to heat the first portion of the steam turbine drive working fluid to a predefined temperature and pressure above that which is in a CSP inlet to the steam boiler; and causing the first portion of the steam turbine drive working fluid to be combined with the second portion of the working fluid at the inlet. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprising: feeding steam generated by the steam boiler of the HRSG to a second CSP field; causing the second CSP field to superheat the steam resulting in the formation of superheated steam; and directing the superheated steam from the second CSP field to a steam generator to drive a steam turbine. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprising: causing a supplemental fossil fuel generated heat to be added to the HRSG such that temperature of steam produced by the HRSG is maintained within an inlet operating tolerance of the steam boiler, the supplemental fossil fuel generated heat being added if a CSP thermal energy contribution to the HRSG falls below a predetermined threshold. 4. The method of claim 1, further including: storing in a database a plurality of operational rules governing increasing power generation efficiency of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant in which predefined atmospheric conditions are predicted to occur in proximity to the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant; receiving atmospheric condition prediction information relating to an atmospheric event; retrieving an operational rule from the plurality of operational rules that relates to the atmospheric event; and controlling an aspect of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant in accordance with the retrieved operational rule. 5. The method of claim 1, further including: storing in a database a plurality of operational rules governing increasing power generation efficiency of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant in which predefined atmospheric conditions are predicted to occur in proximity to the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant; operating the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant by a selected operational rule, from the plurality of operational rules, in accordance with the predicted atmospheric event; causing a learning system to monitor a performance aspect of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant during its operation in accordance with the selected operational rule during the predicted atmospheric event; and causing the learning system to modify the selected operational rule based on a learned behavior determined in response to the monitoring step.
