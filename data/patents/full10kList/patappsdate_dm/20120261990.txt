A photovoltaic power system can include a photovoltaic array, an inverter, and a battery.
Claims 1.-52. (canceled) 53. A system of generating power of reduced power output rate change variability comprising: a photovoltaic array; an inverter connected to the photovoltaic array; and an auxiliary power source, wherein the inverter produces alternating current output power to a grid. 54. The system of claim 53, further comprising a plant control system controlling the inverter and auxiliary power source, measuring the rate of change of power from the photovoltaic array, and adjusting the auxiliary power source output to limit a plant output power rate of change within a power output rate change band when combined with the photovoltaic power, wherein the power output rate change band defines a maximum allowable positive and a maximum allowable negative limit for the plant power output rate of change. 55. The system of claim 54, further comprising separate and independently adjustable set points for positive and negative power rate change limits. 56. The system of claim 55, further comprising a negative power rate change limit adjustable between 0 and -100%. 57. The system of claim 55, further comprising a positive power rate change limit adjustable between 0 and +100%. 58. The system of claim 54, further comprising set points that can be pre-set and then automatically changed by the plant control system in response to time of day; current, scheduled, or anticipated photovoltaic plant operating conditions; or current or anticipated weather conditions. 59. The system of claim 54, wherein the auxiliary power source comprises a stored energy system.
