In a digital TV broadcast signal receiving system, an outdoor appliance comprises a tuner for receiving a TV broadcast signal transmitted from a TV tower or a broadcast satellite, a signal demodulator for demodulating the TV broadcast signal, and a first wireless interface for transmitting data with a second wireless interface provided in an indoor appliance. The indoor appliance further has a signal decoder for separating an audio signal and a visual signal and outputs them to a monitor apparatus. An appliance such as a personal computer having no tuner circuit can receive the TV broadcast signal if it has a wireless interface such as a wireless LAN. Furthermore, the data communication between the outdoor appliance and the indoor appliance is performed by wireless interfaces, so that a cable connecting between an outdoor appliance and an indoor appliance can be omitted.
Claims 1. A digital TV broadcast signal receiving system comprised of an outdoor appliance placed in an outdoor location and an indoor appliance placed in an indoor location, wherein the outdoor appliance has: a tuner to which an antenna for receiving a terrestrial digital TV broadcast signal and an antenna for receiving a satellite digital TV broadcast signal placed in an outdoor location are connected, and which receives a TV broadcast signal through the multi-directional antenna; a signal demodulator for demodulating the TV broadcast signal received by the tuner; a first main controller for controlling each department of the indoor appliance; and a first wireless interface for transmitting the demodulated signal by a format in compliance with a predetermined technical standard; and the indoor appliance has: a second wireless interface for receiving the demodulated signal transmitted from the first wireless interface in compliance with the predetermined technical standard; a signal decoder for decoding the demodulated signal received by the second wireless interface, separating the demodulated signal into an audio signal and a visual signal and outputting them to a monitor apparatus; and a second main controller for controlling each department of the indoor appliance. 2. The digital TV broadcast signal receiving system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the second main controller outputs a control signal when reception channel is changed by a user; the second wireless interface transmits the control signal to the first wireless interface in compliance with the predetermined technical standard; the first wireless interface receives the control signal in compliance with the predetermined technical standard and outputs the received control signal to the first main controller; and the first main controller changes reception frequency of the tuner corresponding to the control signal. 3. A digital TV broadcast signal receiving system comprising; a tuner to which an antenna for receiving a terrestrial digital TV broadcast signal and an antenna for receiving a satellite digital TV broadcast signal placed in an outdoor location are connected, and which receives a TV broadcast signal through the multi-directional antenna; a signal demodulation means for demodulating the TV broadcast signal received by the tuner; and a signal decoding means for decoding the demodulated signal, separating the demodulated signal into an audio signal and a visual signal and outputting them to a monitor apparatus; wherein the tuner and the signal demodulation means are provided in an outdoor appliance placed in an outdoor location, and the signal decoding means is provided in an indoor apparatus which is placed in an indoor location and can perform bidirectional data communication with the outdoor appliance; a photovoltaic means for supplying electric power to each department of the outdoor appliance, a first wireless interface which perform wireless communication with the indoor appliance in compliance with a predetermined wireless LAN technical standard or IEEE 1394 technical standard, and a first control means for controlling each department of the outdoor appliance are further provided in the outdoor appliance; a second wireless interface which perform wireless communication with the outdoor appliance and a second control means for controlling each department of the indoor appliance are further provided in the indoor appliance; the first wireless interface transmits the demodulated signal by the signal demodulation means to the second wireless interface, and the second wireless interface transfers the received demodulated signal to the signal decoding means; when a reception channel of the tuner is changed, the second control means transmits a control signal for changing the reception channel of the tuner to the first control signal through the second wireless interface and the first wireless interface; and the first control means changes reception frequency of the tuner corresponding to the control signal, thereby, the digital TV broadcast signal can be received by the indoor appliance and the reception channel can be changed from the indoor appliance with laying no cable from the outdoor to the indoor, and the effective signal receiving direction of the multi-directional antenna can be optimized corresponding to the reception channel. 4. An outdoor appliance used in a digital TV broadcast signal receiving system comprising: a tuner to which an antenna for receiving a terrestrial digital TV broadcast signal and an antenna for receiving a satellite digital TV broadcast signal placed in an outdoor location are connected, and which receives a TV broadcast signal through the multi-directional antenna; a signal demodulator for demodulating the TV broadcast signal received by the tuner; a main controller for controlling each department of the indoor appliance; a wireless interface for transmitting the demodulated signal by a format in compliance with a predetermined technical standard with another wireless interface provided in an indoor apparatus placed in an indoor location; and a solar cell for supplying electric power to each department of the outdoor appliance and to the multi-directional antenna. 5. The outdoor appliance used in a digital TV broadcast signal receiving system in accordance with claim 4, wherein the solar cell is provided on a top face or a front face of a housing of the outdoor appliance; a heat sink for radiating heat generated by electronic elements mounted in an inside of the outdoor appliance is provided on a bottom face or a rear face of the housing; and the housing has properties of adiathermanous and waterproof, so that each element in the inside of housing of the outdoor appliance is protected from heat and water by the heat sink and the housing.
