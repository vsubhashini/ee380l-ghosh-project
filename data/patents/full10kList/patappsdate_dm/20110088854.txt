The present invention comprised of a flexible sunscreen and designed to be attached to the interior surface of a vehicle's rear window and configured to cover all or portions thereof for the purpose of reducing solar heat energy and ultraviolet radiation from entering into the interior compartment of said vehicle. The use of this solar shade will reduce the need for interior cooling, fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions when used in vehicles that require interior cooling by means of mechanical air conditioning.
Claims 1. A removable solar sunscreen designed to be mounted onto the interior surface of a vehicle's rear window for the purpose of inhibiting the transfer of solar heat energy and ultraviolet radiation into the interior compartment of the associated vehicle. Said device will also provide protection against the fading and degradation of interior components of said vehicle. 2. Said invention is comprised of a flexible sunscreen mesh having an outer peripheral edge of Velcro tape and a corresponding Velcro strip of identical shape and size affixed to the inner surface of said rear window. Velcro tape is used as a means for mounting and dismounting the flexible sunscreen onto the interior surface of the window. The screen can be easily removed and re-installed as dictated by conditions i.e., time of day or night, angle of sunrays, time of year, the direct and/or indirect exposure to high levels of solar heat energy and radiation or personal preference. Screen fabric is comprised of a woven flexible mesh with high ultraviolet block designed to reduce solar heat transfer and to protect the vehicle passenger compartment from radiation while reducing sun or headlight glare. Said screen is offered in various colors, which is intended to enhance a vehicle's atheistic appeal. Screen can be imprinted with or without logo for personalization where copyright permits.
