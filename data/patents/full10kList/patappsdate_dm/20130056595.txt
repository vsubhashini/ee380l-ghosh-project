A mount system for a photovoltaic (PV) panel array allows for ease of installation, flexibility of movement, and the ability to remove and redeploy the system as needed. The mounting system includes a plurality of standoff mounts which are secured to a substrate in a grid system, elongated mounting rails which are secured onto the standoff mounts in parallel, and attachment rails secured to opposing side edges of the PV panels. The attachment rails and mounting rails include interfitting mating formations which interlock to suspend the PV panels between the mounting rails and above the substrate.
Claims 1. A mount system for a photovoltaic panel comprising: a plurality of standoff mounts each having a base portion securable to a substrate in a linear array at a predetermined spacing, said plurality of standoff mounts further having a neck portion extending upwardly from the base portion; a mounting rail having a central spine including at least one side edge and a plurality of openings arranged longitudinally along said central spine at a predetermined spacing matching said spacing of said standoff mounts, said mounting rail being supported on said neck portions of said standoff mounts above said substrate, said mounting rail being secured to said plurality of standoff mounts; and an attachment rail having an inner land portion onto which a side edge portion of a PV panel is seated and secured and an outer retaining tab portion, said at least one side edge of said central spine of said mounting rail and said outer retaining tab portion of said attachment rail including interfitting mating formations which are removably received and secured together whereby said PV panel is removably secured to said mounting rail. 2. The mount system of claim 1 wherein said mounting rail comprising a female track having a central spine and opposed outwardly facing mounting channels on opposing sides of said central spine, and further wherein said attachment rail comprises a male track insert having outer retaining tab portion which is received into one of said opposed mounting channels in said female track whereby said PV panel is secured to said female track. 3. The mount system of claim 1 further comprising a plurality of fasteners which are received through the openings in said mounting rail and secured in the neck portions of corresponding aligned standoff mounts, whereby said mounting rail is secured to said standoff mounts. 4. The mount system of claim 3 wherein said fasteners are a threaded bolt and cap nut, said cap nut being received in said neck portion of said standoff mount and said threaded bolt being received through said opening in said mounting rail and into said cap nut in said neck portion of said standoff mount. 5. The mount system of claim 2 wherein said retaining tab of said male insert and said mounting channels of said female track include interfitting locking formations. 6. The mount system of claim 1 further comprising a wind shield having a retaining portion and a shield portion extending outwardly and downwardly from said retaining portion. 7. The mount system of claim 1 wherein said mounting rail includes a wire management channel. 8. The mount system of claim 2 wherein said female track further includes a J-shaped wire management channel extending downwardly from an underside of one of said opposed mounting channels. 9. The mount system of claim 1 further comprising a plurality of annular bonding rings having a diameter greater than a diameter of said base portion of said standoff mounts, said bonding rings having a central opening which is received over said neck portion of said standoff mount, said bonding rings being bonded to said substrate to secure said standoff mounts to said substrate. 10. The mount system of claim 1 wherein said substrate is an elastomeric membrane, said mount system further comprising a plurality of annular bonding rings formed from an elastomeric membrane material and having a diameter greater than a diameter of said base portion of said standoff mounts, said bonding rings having a central opening which is received over said neck portion of said standoff mount, said elastomeric membrane bonding rings being bonded to said membrane to secure said standoff mounts to said membrane. 11. The mount system of claim 1 wherein said plurality of standoff mounts are bonded to a carrier tape with a predetermined spacing. 12. The mount system of claim 1 wherein said substrate is an elastomeric membrane, said plurality of standoff mounts being bonded to an elastomeric membrane carrier tape with a predetermined spacing. 13. The mount system of claim 1 further comprising a bonding tape having a plurality of openings at a predetermined spacing, said plurality of openings being received over said neck portions of said standoff mounts, said bonding tape being bonded to said substrate to secure said standoff mounts to said substrate. 14. The mount system of claim 1 wherein said substrate is an elastomeric membrane, said mount system further comprising a bonding tape having a plurality of openings at a predetermined spacing, plurality of openings being received over said neck portions of said standoff mounts, said bonding tape being bonded to said membrane to secure said standoff mounts to said membrane 15. The mount system of claim 1 wherein said plurality of standoff mounts are bonded to a carrier strapping. 16. The mount system of claim 1 wherein said attachment rail further includes a separating shoulder extending upwardly between said land portion and said retaining portion. 17. A mounting rail for a photovoltaic panel comprising: a central spine including a plurality of openings arranged at a predetermined spacing; and at least one outwardly facing mounting channel. 18. The mounting rail of claim 17 further comprising a wire management channel extending downwardly from an underside of said at least one mounting channels. 19. The mounting rail of claim 18 wherein said wire management channel is J-shaped.
