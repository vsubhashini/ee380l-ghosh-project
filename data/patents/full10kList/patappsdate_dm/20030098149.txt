A method for treating a relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons in situ may include providing heat from one or more heat sources to a portion of the formation. The heat may be allowed to transfer from the heat sources to a selected section of the formation. The transferred heat may reduce the viscosity of at least some hydrocarbons within the selected section. A gas may be produced to the selected section of the formation. The gas may produce a flow of hydrocarbons within the selected section. A mixture of hydrocarbons may be produced from the selected section.
