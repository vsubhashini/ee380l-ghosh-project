Methods and systems are provided for air conditioning, capturing combustion contaminants, desalination, and other processes using liquid desiccants.
Claims 1. A solar air conditioning system, comprising, an air conditioning unit for treating an air stream entering a building space, the air conditioning unit including an outer enclosure for protecting air conditioning unit components from the environment; one or more photovoltaic modules for converting solar energy into direct current electricity; and a solar inverter coupled to the one or more photovoltaic modules for inverting the direct current electricity generated by the one or more photovoltaic modules to alternating current electricity for powering the air conditioning unit, said solar inverter being positioned within the outer enclosure of the air conditioning system. 2. The solar air conditioning system of claim 1, wherein the one or more photovoltaic modules are part of a photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) module. 3. The solar air conditioning system of claim 2, wherein said PVT module further comprises a water storage tank beneath the one or more photovoltaic modules for storing water heated by the PVT module and functioning as a ballast for the PVT module. 4. The solar air conditioning system of claim 1, wherein the air conditioning unit comprises a desiccant air conditioning system, and wherein the air conditioning components include a desiccant conditioner and a desiccant regenerator. 5. The solar air conditioning system of claim 4, wherein the one or more photovoltaic modules are part of a photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) module, said PVT module heating liquid desiccant to be introduced in the regenerator in a warm weather operation mode and for heating liquid desiccant to be introduced in the conditioner in a cold weather operation mode.
