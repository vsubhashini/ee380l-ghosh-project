Process for space time detection with the past, present and future using factual real life objects, actions and events allowing for desired actions. The process can run on any chosen computer system or software using file or database formats containing the object information or can be processed with human intellect without computers. Information is entered into a file or database system with automated or manual methods storing the date and time of the objects being people, places and things. The objects locations and surroundings are mapped and stored. Information about the objects are obtained and if not on file they are entered. A recognition process is then used to decode variations of the object information and written to storage. As each record is stored an automated monitoring, reporting alarm and analysis process is then available for human or computer analysis allowing for any preprogrammed or chosen action.
Claims 1. A new process for a space time continuum intercept detection system that interacts with the past, present and future using factual and real life objects, actions and events in space and time to detect past, present and future events and actions allowing for desired actions. 2. The process of claim 1 where computers are used to process the result. 3. This process of claim 1 allows for it to be run on any capable computer operating system and language and hardware with any chosen files and database formats and capable application software. 4. The process of claim 1 where humans are used to process the result with or without computers. 5. The process of claim 1 allows for new information via input output automated processes and or human or other interaction allowing for continuous information collection and analysis. 6.
