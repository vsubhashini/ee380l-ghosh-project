Disclosed is a spectrum spread communication system which is hardly influenced by noises, and in which a frame structure can be identified at a receiving side without use of a frame synchronization signal. A spread code generator switches spread codes ("Scai" and "Scbi") in each frame, and outputs it to a spread modulation unit. The spread modulation unit performs spread modulation of transmission data, and transmits it to a direct current power line. A reference code generator generates reference codes ("Scai" and "Scbi") in the same code phase. Spread demodulation units performs spread demodulation of the received signal with use of the reference codes ("Scai" and "Scbi"), and output it to a selection unit. A frame synchronization detection unit identifies a frame structure on the basis of switching of a synchronization state of a code phase in a code phase synchronization detection unit. The selection unit outputs reception data by selecting spread demodulated data from the spread demodulation unit which is in a phase-synchronized state.
