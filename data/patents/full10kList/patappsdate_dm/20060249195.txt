A method for the startup of a solar power inverter in which a waiting period is increased between successive attempts to start the inverter. This method allows the inverter to start up in a reasonable amount of time while avoiding excessive cycling during prolonged periods of low light.
Claims 1. A method of operating an inverter connected to a photovoltaic panel comprising the steps of: a) monitoring DC voltage input to the inverter and waiting for a the DC voltage to exceed a predetermined value, keeping the inverter shut down until said DC voltage exceeds said DC value; b) interrupting operation of said inverter if the DC power level or said DC voltage is below a predetermined value; c) if operation of said inverter is interrupted then waiting for a predetermined period of time before resuming operation of said inverter; and d) repeating steps b and c and increasing said predetermined period of time between successive resumptions of operation. 2. The method of claim 1 further comprising a step between method steps a and b in which said inverter is operated for a predetermined period of time before checking the DC power level and DC voltage. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein said predetermined period of time decreases to the original period of time after a predetermined number of startup attempts. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein said predetermined period of time reaches a maximum value after a predetermined number of startup attempts and is held at said maximum value for successive startup attempts. 5. The method of claim 3 wherein said predetermined period of time follows a pattern of 5 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes and then back to 5 minutes to repeat the pattern.
