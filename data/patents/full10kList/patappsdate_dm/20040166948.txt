A golf-related video recording apparatus and method comprises a tee-off area, and a green area. A field house structure is positioned adjacent the tee-off area and houses video recording and playback equipment and a solar powered electrical power source for powering video equipment. Video cameras are positioned in the tee-off area and the green area and are able to download four channels of video data wirelessly to the video equipment. Motion actuation of the video cameras and coin operated actuation of the system enables capture of drives and putts, and presentation on a video monitor as well as recording on media.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A golf-related game with video recording system apparatus comprising: a golf course comprising at least one hole, each said hole consisting of at least a tee area, and a green area, and for each said hole, positioned at the tee area, a field-house structure sheltering: a) a computer providing a four channel wireless video data stream receiving, storing, media recording and video playback means enabled for outputting the four video data streams simultaneously, and further enabled for producing a media recording thereof; b) a video monitor adapted for receiving and displaying the four video data streams simultaneously; and c) an electrical power source including a photovoltaic solar display enabled for powering a battery, and an inverter for converting direct current from the battery into an alternating current powering the computer and the video monitor; a set of four solar powered video cameras each having a motion sensor actuation switch, a first one of the video cameras directed at the tee area; a second, third and fourth ones of the video cameras, each directed, from a different angle, at a cup on the green area; the video cameras enabled for wireless video data stream communication with the computer for video data stream input thereto; and a coin operated system switch for moving the apparatus from a standby mode to an operational mode, when a golfing party is ready to tee-off. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the first video camera is positioned for viewing a line of flight of a golf ball drive from the tee area. 3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the second, third and fourth video cameras are positioned for viewing a golf ball arrival on the green area and for viewing all strokes on the green area. 4. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising a charging connector adapted for enabling charging of the battery by a standard ac power source. 5. A golf-related game method using a video recording system apparatus, the method comprising the steps of: providing a golf course comprising at least one hole, each said hole consisting of at least a tee area, and a green area; positioning a field-house structure at, at least one of the tee areas; sheltering within the at least one field-house structure: a) a computer providing a four channel wireless video data stream receiving, storing, media recording and video playback means enabled for outputting the four video data streams simultaneously, and further enabled for producing a media recording thereof; b) a video monitor adapted for receiving and displaying the four video data streams simultaneously; and c) an electrical power source including a photovoltaic solar display enabled for powering a battery, and an inverter for converting direct current from the battery into an alternating current powering the computer and the video monitor; providing a set of four solar powered video cameras each having a motion sensor actuation switch; directing a first one of the video cameras at the tee area; directing a second, third and fourth ones of the video cameras, each from a different angle, at a cup on the green area; enabling the video cameras for wireless video data stream communication with the computer for video data stream input thereto; actuating a coin operated system switch for providing electrical energy to the system; moving the apparatus from a standby mode to an operational mode, when a golfing party is ready to tee-off; recording tee-off events by motion activation of the first camera when the golfing party provides motion on the tee area; recording green area events by motion activation of the second, third and fourth cameras when the golfing party provides motion on the green area.
