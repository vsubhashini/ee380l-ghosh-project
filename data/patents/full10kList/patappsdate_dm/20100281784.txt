f) the method; formation; configuration and usage of the vertical & horizontal boxed-out spaces aligned horizontally at 90 degrees against along with floor joists facilitates the effective arrangement of laying & installing & directing pipes or tubes; water lines and electrical wiring to appropriate positions via between floor joists and facilitates the active thermal forced air travel through the claimed void spaces (cited in claim 10. in the parent application) which are underneath the sub-floor and between floor joists. 50. the combination and the interaction of the configuration & the formation & the methodology & the utilization of the active thermal forced air circulation system in direct conjunction with the corrugated metal components to be used in ceilings, & floors & wall structures of which the "void" spaces on one side or on both sides of the corrugated configuration to be utilized as the active thermal forced air path transforming into a 3 stages composite insulation structure comprises a dual corrugated forced air path sandwiched the corrugated metal member to be utilized as a "heat sink" and not to be limited on any walls & floors corrugated structures for commercial and or industrial buildings for the purposes of regulating temperature and or for climate controls. 51. the combination and the interaction of the configuration & the formation & the methodology & the utilization of the active thermal forced air system applies directly to the roof line underneath the roof sheathing wherein composite insulated rigid foam panels created in between the foam members having at least one active forced air cavity/passage at one end connected 90 degree against with the openings on the side of an elongated central channel gathering and allowing all forced airs channeled from said multiple composite insulated rigid foam panels flow into the cavity of said openings of the elongated central channel to be dissipated and be redirected for the purposes of regulating the temperature and or for climate controls.
