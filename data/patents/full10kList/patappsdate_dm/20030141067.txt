An oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. A mixture of hydrocarbons, H.sub.2, and/or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Heat may be applied to the formation to raise a temperature of a portion of the formation to a pyrolysis temperature. Heat may also be applied to the formation to increase a permeability of the formation. In some embodiments, the permeability of a portion of the formation may increase to a relatively high permeability as compared to the initial permeability.
