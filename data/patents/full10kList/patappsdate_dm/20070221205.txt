A self powered pelletized fuel heating device comprising a thermal electric generator (TEG) unit therein powering a typical collection of low voltage system components including a storage power unit. Non-typically, the heating device requires no external power supply and relies on thermodynamic principles using the pelletized fuel as a heat source. The TEG is configured and positioned optimally for conventional operation and installation requirements without modification to normal form or function.
