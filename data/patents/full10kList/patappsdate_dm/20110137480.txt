Supplying supplemental superheated steam to a steam turbine in a solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant feeding steam from a boiler portion of a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant to a concentrated solar power (CSP) field to superheat the steam resulting in the formation of superheated steam and directing the superheated steam from the CSP field to a steam generator to drive the steam turbine.
Claims 1. A method of supplying supplemental superheated steam to a steam turbine in a solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant, the method comprising: feeding steam from a boiler portion of a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant to a concentrated solar power (CSP) field; causing the CSP field to superheat the steam resulting in the formation of superheated steam; and directing the superheated steam from the CSP field to a steam generator to drive the steam turbine. 2. The method of claim 1, further including: storing in a database a plurality of operational rules governing supplying supplemental superheated steam to a steam turbine in the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant in which predefined atmospheric conditions are predicted to occur in proximity to the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant; receiving atmospheric condition prediction information relating to an atmospheric event; retrieving an operational rule from the plurality of operational rules that relates to the atmospheric event; and controlling an aspect of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant in accordance with the retrieved operational rule. 3. The method of claim 1, further including: storing in a database a plurality of operational rules governing supplying supplemental superheated steam to a steam turbine in the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant in which predefined atmospheric conditions are predicted to occur in proximity to the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant; operating the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant by a selected operational rule, from the plurality of operational rules, in accordance with the predicted atmospheric event; causing a learning system to monitor a performance aspect of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant during its operation in accordance with the selected operational rule during the predicted atmospheric event; and causing the learning system to modify the selected operational rule based on a learned behavior determined in response to the monitoring step.
