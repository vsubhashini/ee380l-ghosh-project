The purpose of the present invention is to provide a method for disposing a photoelectric conversion element accurately on the focal point of a condenser lens. The method of the present invention comprises a step of forming a focal point on the reverse surface of the condenser lens to be a hydrophilic region, a step of removing the remained photoresist to obtain the condenser lens having the reverse surface where the hydrophilic region is surrounded by a water-repellent region formed of the fluoroalkylsilane film and a step of disposing the photoelectric conversion element on the hydrophilic region to obtain the solar cell comprising the condenser lens and the photoelectric conversion element.
