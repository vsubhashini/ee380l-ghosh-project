A portable sign illumination system that can provide its own power for illumination, based on solar panels, is light in weight, easy to install, and can be locked onto the sign frame. It can fit sign frames that are presently on the market, and be easily modified to fit many other sign frames. The system employs a light reflecting system to direct light onto the sign.
