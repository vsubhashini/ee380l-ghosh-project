Claims 1. A method for microgrid distributed power generation and management comprising the steps of: providing a microgrid distributed power generation system including at least one power generation equipment for generating electrical power located at predetermined, distributed locations for providing emergency back-up power supply for use at the locations of power generation, wherein the microgrid is associated with a grid for distributing power over a larger geographic area than the microgrid; providing a controller system connected to the at least one power generation equipment, the controller system further including: a monitoring device in communication connection that monitors the at least one power generation equipment; at least one server computer, located centrally or distributed over a network, the at least one server computer in network communication with the monitoring device and a controller connected to a power distribution switch associated with and connected to the at least one power generation equipment, and operable for generating event instructions to a controllable device for releasing and/or preventing release of electrical power to the power grid for distribution when a predetermined conditions exist; wherein each controllable device is operable for selectively enabling and disabling the flow of electric power from the electric storage to an electric microgrid, for distribution; a device interface for facilitating and producing communication of power releasing and/or preventing power release instructions to at least one controllable device for selective power generation and disconnect of any of the at least one power generation equipment from the microgrid or grid; and the at least one server computer automatically selectively activating the power generation equipment to produce electricity for distribution over the microgrid and/or for storage until later distribution via the microgrid based upon instructions from the controller. 2. The method of claim 1, further including the step of the at least one server computer automatically coordinating selective activation of a multiplicity of emergency power generation equipment during any period wherein power failure on the grid is detected. 3. The method of claim 1, further including the step of the system providing for automatic power storage of power generated by the equipment. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the method provides for the selective activation of the power generation equipment to occur at detection of power failure in the grid, and the system server computer automatically requesting curtailment from a utility company controlling supply and billing for power received through the grid. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the system further includes an automated remote controller for activating the at least one piece of equipment based upon instruction received by the controller from the remote server computer for automatically generating power for use locally during a period of power failure in the grid. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the system further includes a remote server computer in networked communication with the at least one piece of equipment for monitoring the status of the equipment and for activating the equipment remotely. 7. A system for microgrid distributed power generation and management comprising: a multiplicity of power generation equipment located at predetermined, distributed locations for providing emergency back-up power supply for use in situs, without distribution of the electrical power beyond the locality where it is generated upon automatic detection of power failure in a wider grid to which the microgrid is connected, including the power generation equipment; and a monitoring device that tracks real time wholesale energy market price; a database for storing wholesale energy market price; an analyzing device for storing and analyzing wholesale market price data, and on a per power storage device basis, data indicative of the electricity remaining in that specific device; at least one server computer, located centrally or distributed over a network, the at least one server computer in network communication for monitoring and being responsive to the market price fluctuation analysis, and operable for generating event instructions to a controllable device for releasing electrical power to the power grid for distribution when the market price is at least at a predetermined threshold at which point the power generated is directed to be released and sold to the power grid (note that the power may be generated directly for immediate distribution or for temporary storage before distribution); a device interface for facilitating and producing communication of power releasing instructions to at lease one controllable device on power storage device; at lease one controllable device associated with and preferably connected to the at least one power generator and/or electricity storage device, wherein each controllable device is operable for selectively enabling and disabling or disconnecting the flow of electric power from the electric storage to an electric microgrid, for distribution thereby; and selectively activating the power generation equipment to produce electricity for distribution over the microgrid and/or for storage until later distribution via the microgrid following selective disconnection of the power generation equipment due to a trigger event; wherein the equipment is remotely, selectively, and automatically activatable, and constructed and configured in connection with an electrical power microgrid to produce electricity local use over the microgrid and/or for storage until later distribution over the microgrid. 8. The system of claim 7, further including more than one power generation equipment that is operable for coordinated, selective activation. 9. The system of claim 7, further including a multiplicity of emergency power generation equipment positioned apart over a predetermined geographic area for distribution and/or storage to supply a microgrid of electrical power. 10. The system of claim 7, wherein the at least one equipment is automatically selectively activatable at predetermined times and automatically selectively disconnected from the microgrid or wide area grid. 11. A system for power generation management comprising: a microgrid distributed power generation system constructed and configured for automatically managing electricity generation and releasing by a cell tower emergency power backup generator based on power failure detection, including at least one power generator, the at least one power generator including at least one electricity generator, wherein the at least one power generator is associated with a cell tower for the use of emergency backup during electricity blackout, constructed and configured to generate electricity for immediate supply through direct connection into a microgrid electrical distribution system and/or further includes at least one energy storage mechanism for providing temporary power storage for selectively discharging electricity into a microgrid when a wider grid of distributed power experiences a power failure or disruption that is detected by a monitoring device in networked communication to a controller connected to the emergency power generator, and for any of the at least one power generator may be selectively disconnected or disengaged from providing power supply to the microgrid or wider area grid. 12. The system of claim 11, wherein the at least one power generator is selected from the group consisting of solar arrays, natural gas generators, propane generators, diesel generators, and combinations thereof.
