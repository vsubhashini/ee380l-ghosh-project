A scalable distributed wireless control and monitoring system for managing utility supply over a wide geographical area. Such distributed networks can manage/control electricity, gas, water and other petroleum product supply to a large geographical area. The network consist of plurality of nodes that control and monitor utility usage at subscriber point; these nodes are called activityNode. The ActivityNodes can communicate with one or plurality of superNodes. The superNodes act as center for control and management for the activityNodes. The superNode can send "instruction to disconnect" a subscriber to an ActivityNode. A superNode can exchange data with one or plurality of neighboring superNodes. An aggregate of superNodes can poll data from plurality of activityNodes on the network, this information can be analyzed to determine the network performance and can also be use to preempt fault on any part of the network.

In the activityNode, the intelligent unit has exclusive access and control over the sensor and actuator devices; the intelligent unit can transmit data through the repeater unit on that node, but the reverse is not permitted; the activityNode can take power from different sources depending on the utility distribution; for electricity distribution, the power can come from the mains supply with a backup battery system which is charged from the mains; for petroleum product, water or domestic gas distribution, a mini turbine which is driven by the fluid flowing through the pipe or a solar panel can be used to charge a battery power supply system. 7. The intelligent unit in the activityNode can generate bill for the measure of utility that passed through it for the billing cycle; the superNode synchronize all activityNode on the mesh to the start and end of the billing cycle; and although more than one superNode can be present in a mesh network, only one can engage an activityNode unit in communication at any point in time; wherein plurality of superNodes are present in a mesh, they can form virtual mesh networks with batches of activityNode, such that within a mesh, they could be several other sub-mesh networks called "Independent Wireless Utility Network" and an aggregate of Independent Wireless Utility Network will form a parent network called "Distributed Wireless Utility Mesh Network". 8. The system of claim 1, such that the Intelligent and Repeater units of the activityNode have separate antennas, which are dedicated for their communication; moreso, the superNode have two dedicated transceivers, one for communication with plurality of activityNodes and the other for communication with plurality of neighboring superNodes; the superNode also have a high speed Ethernet port that allows it to be integrated to a Computer system which can have third party application and resource that the superNode can use when necessary. 9. The method of claim 8, wherein the superNode can use the application or processing power from a computer to analyze the data from a set of activityNodes in a mesh and thus use the result to determine the performance of the mesh network; and this performance analysis could be extended to allow the superNode preempt or detect a fault on the utility distribution system. 10. The network of claim 1, wherein an activityNode is added to an existing mesh, network, it will send a request to attach using one of its default registration channels through any of the neighboring nodes on that network to the superNode; he superNode will grant or deny the request to attach depending on the details of the new activityNode; he decision of the superNode is relayed back top the requesting node through one of its default registration channel. 11. The method of claim 1, in an Electricity distribution system to consumer outlets; and a single or three-phase sensor monitors the amount of power passing through onto the consumer and generates a bill based on this when requested by the superNode; wherein a single phase or three phase actuator is built into the activityNode such that the superNode can instruct the activityNode to connect or disconnect the consumer when necessary; and when a consumer point is disconnected from the utility distribution, the intelligent module still draw power for its internal operation from the mains supply and it will continue to check if power is still passing through to the consumer or if the node is tempered. 12. Method of claim 11, wherein the mesh network is modified and adapted for domestic gas or water supply network for a large geographical area; where the enclosure for the activityNode is modified such that it will provide ingress protection; and the sensing device could be intrusive on non-intrusive; the actuator device will make it possible to control the flow of gas or water and the primary source of power for the activityNode in such installation is from the battery supply which can be recharged from a solar panel or turbine. 13.
