A method for treating lean and rich zones of a hydrocarbon containing formation is provided. In one embodiment, heat from one or more heaters may be provided to at least a portion of the formation. Heat may be allowed to transfer from the one or more heaters to a first part of the formation. In certain embodiments, the heat from the one or more heaters may pyrolyze at least some hydrocarbons within the first part of the formation. The method may include producing a mixture through a second part of the formation. In some embodiments, the produced mixture may include at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons from the first part of the formation. In an embodiment, the second part of the formation may have a higher permeability than the first part of the formation.
