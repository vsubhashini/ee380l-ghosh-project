Systems and methods of using a computer system to simulate a process for in situ treatment of a hydrocarbon containing formation are provided. The in situ process may include providing heat from one or more heat sources to at least one portion of the formation. The in situ process may, in some embodiments, include allowing the heat to transfer from the one or more heat sources to a selected section of the formation. In some embodiments, the method may include operating the in situ process using one or more operating parameters. At least one operating parameter of the in situ process may be provided to the computer system. In certain embodiments, at least one parameter may be used with a simulation method and the computer system to provide assessed information about the in situ process.
