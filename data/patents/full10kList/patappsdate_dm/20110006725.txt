A portable container having an exterior surface and defining an interior compartment. The portable container includes a photovoltaic (PV) charging pack and a receiving device coupled to the exterior surface for detachably coupling the PV charging pack to the exterior surface. The PV charging pack includes a PV panel and defines a compartment for containing a portable electronic device. The PV panel is oriented away from the exterior surface when the PV charging pack is coupled to the receiving device.
Claims 1. A portable container having an exterior surface and defining an interior compartment, the portable container comprising: a photovoltaic (PV) charging pack comprising a PV panel and defining a compartment for containing a portable electronic device; and a PV charging pack receiving device coupled to the exterior surface for detachably coupling the PV charging pack to the exterior surface, wherein the PV panel is configured to absorb light energy when the PV charging pack is coupled to the receiving device. 2. The portable container of claim 1, wherein the PV charging pack further comprises a concealing flap for covering the PV panel. 3. The portable container of claim 1, wherein the PV charging pack further comprises an armband. 4. The portable container of claim 1, wherein the receiving device is a first receiving device, the portable container further comprising a second receiving device. 5. The portable container of claim 1, wherein the receiving device comprises a zipper. 6. The portable container of claim 1, further comprising an energy storage device, wherein the PV charging pack comprises a charging connector for electrically coupling the PV charging pack to the energy storage device. 7. The portable container of claim 1, wherein the PV charging pack further comprises a concealing flap for covering the PV panel. 8. The portable container of claim 1, further comprising a concealing flap coupled to the exterior surface for covering the PV panel. 9. A portable photovoltaic (PV) charging pack comprising: at least one PV panel; a compartment defined by the PV charging pack for containing a portable electronic device; a charging connector electrically coupled to the at least one PV panel; and a mounting device for removably coupling the PV charging pack to a receiving device. 10. The PV charging pack of claim 9, wherein the charging connector is a first charging connector, the PV charging pack further comprising: an energy storage device coupled to the charging connector; and a second charging connector electrically couplable to the energy storage device and a portable electronic device. 11. The PV charging pack of claim 10, wherein the energy storage device is disposable within the compartment. 12. The PV charging pack of claim 9, further comprising a voltage regulator configured to electrically couple the PV panel to the charging connector. 13. The PV charging pack of claim 9, wherein the PV panel is coupled to a first surface of the PV charging pack and the compartment is defined on a second surface of the PV charging pack. 14. The PV charging pack of claim 13, further comprising a panel coupled to the PV charging pack to define the compartment on the second surface, the panel further defining an opening to receive the portable electronic device. 15. The PV charging pack of claim 9, wherein the at least one PV panel is a first PV panel, the PV charging pack further comprising: a first structural panel having a first interior surface and a first exterior surface, the first exterior surface comprising the first PV panel; and a second structural panel, opposite the first structural panel, having a second interior surface and a second exterior surface, the second exterior surface comprising a second PV panel, wherein the first interior surface faces the second interior surface. 16. The PV charging pack of claim 15, wherein the compartment is defined between the first interior surface and the second interior surface. 17. The PV charging pack of claim 16, further comprising a hanging device. 18.
