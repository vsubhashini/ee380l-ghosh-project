A method for treating a relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons in situ may include providing heat from one or more heat sources to a selected section of the formation. The heat provided to the selected section may pyrolyze at least some hydrocarbons in the selected section. A blending agent may be produced from the selected section. A portion of the blending agent may be adapted to blend with a liquid to produce a mixture with a selected property.
