An impact absorption facility for road makes it possible to protect a road center, a road side, a road ramp, an entering side of a tunnel or an underground road, pillars, faith silk or others and to absorb the impact of vehicle collided and to decelerate during a collision by decreasing the impacts occurring due to the impact of a vehicle by installing the impact absorption facility even in a highway ramp, and it is possible to prevent a vehicle from entering an opposite road lane or going out of a road for thereby allowing the vehicle to run on a normal road and to return to a road. A traffic accident can be effectively prevented with the help of a lighting lamp or a reflection lamp when a vehicle approaches the impact absorption facility when a driver drives at night with sleepiness.
