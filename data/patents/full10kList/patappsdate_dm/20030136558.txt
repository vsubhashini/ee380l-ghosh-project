An oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. Heat may be provided from one or more heat sources. Heat may be allowed to transfer from the heat sources to a section of the formation. Hydrocarbons, H.sub.2, and/or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Conditions in a section of the formation may be controlled to produced a desired product.
