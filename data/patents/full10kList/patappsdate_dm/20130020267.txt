A rack assembly is provided for mounting solar modules over an underlying body. The rack assembly may include a plurality of rail structures that are arrangeable over the underlying body to form an overall perimeter for the rack assembly. One or more retention structures may be provided with the plurality of rail structures, where each retention structure is configured to support one or more solar modules at a given height above the underlying body. At least some of the plurality of rail structures are adapted to enable individual rail structures o be sealed over the underlying body so as to constrain air flow underneath the solar modules. Additionally, at least one of (i) one or more of the rail structures, or (ii) the one or more retention structures are adjustable so as to adapt the rack assembly to accommodate solar modules of varying forms or dimensions.
Claims 1. A rack assembly for mounting solar modules over an underlying body, the rack assembly comprising: a plurality of rail structures that are arrangeable over the underlying body to form an overall perimeter for the rack assembly; one or more retention structures provided with the plurality of rail structures, wherein the retention structures are configured to support one or more solar modules at a given height above the underlying body; and wherein at least some of the plurality of rail structures are adapted to enable individual rail structures in the plurality of rail structures to be sealed over the underlying body so as to constrain air flow underneath the one or more solar modules; and wherein at least one of (i) one or more of the rail structures, or (ii) the one or more retention structures are adjustable so as to adapt the rack assembly to accommodate solar modules of varying forms or dimensions.
