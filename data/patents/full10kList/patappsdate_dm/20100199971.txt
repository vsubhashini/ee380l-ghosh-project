The solar tracker includes a solar position sensor, a controller connected to the solar position sensor, a first motor connected to the controller for rotating the solar cell array according to the azimuth of the sun and a second motor connected to the controller for tilting the solar cell array according to the elevation of the sun. The controlling apparatus includes a central unit, a basic unit, a diagnosis unit, a maintenance unit, a security unit and a check unit.
Claims 1. A controlling apparatus for use in a photovoltaic system comprising a solar cell array, an inverter and a solar tracker comprising a solar position sensor, a controller connected to the solar position sensor, a first motor connected to the controller for rotating the solar cell array according to the azimuth of the sun and a second motor connected to the con troller for tilting the solar cell array according to the elevation of the sun, the controlling apparatus comprising: a central unit; a basic unit operable, under the control of the central unit, in an alignment mode, a night mode and a restoration mode wherein the basic unit determines the direction of driving the solar tracker in the alignment mode, instructs the solar tracker to lay the solar cell array horizontally in the night mode, and executes a restoration mechanism after repair and maintenance of the solar tracker in the restoration mode; a diagnosis unit connected to the central unit for scrutinizing the solar position sensor of the solar tracker, and scrutinizing the first and second motors and the inverter if determining the operation of the solar position sensor to be normal; a maintenance unit operable, under the control of the central unit, in an initialization mode and a download mode, wherein the maintenance unit acquires data of errors of the azimuth and elevation of the solar cell array after installment and re-installment of the solar tracker in the initialization mode, and downloads control programs from the controller of the solar tracker in the download mode; a security unit operable, under the control of the central unit, in a storm mode when the wind speed reaches a predetermined value and a seismic mode in an earthquake, wherein the security unit skips the solar position sensor and instructs the solar tracker to lay the solar cell array horizontally in the storm mode, and skips the solar position sensor and instructs the solar tracker to lay the solar cell array horizontally in the storm mode; and a check unit connected to the central unit for checking a clock built in the controller of the solar tracker, and synchronizing the clock of the controller of the solar tracker with a clock built therein if determining the time told with the clock of the controller of the solar tracker to be different from its own time. 2. The controlling apparatus according to claim 1 wherein if the direct normal irradiance on the photovoltaic system is lower than a threshold for a period of time, the central unit will acquire the azimuth and elevation of the solar tracker compare the same with track data, and start the alignment mode of the basic unit to send a STOP signal to the controller of the solar tracker. 3. The controlling apparatus according to claim 1, wherein if the direct normal irradiance on the photovoltaic system is larger than the threshold, i.e., the elevation of the sun is higher than an angle, the central unit will start the alignment mode of the basic unit to send an ACT signal to the controller of the solar tracker. 4. The controlling apparatus according to claim 1, wherein if the direct normal irradiance on the photovoltaic system is lower than the threshold, the central unit will start the diagnosis unit to scrutinize the solar position sensor, the first and second motors and the inverter.
