The automatic nail fastening device of claim 1 further comprising at least one rail attached to the frame for mounting said at least one nail gun so that said at least one nail gun can be laterally adjusted along the length of the rail. 17. The automatic nail fastening device of claim 1 wherein an angle of said at least one nail gun is adjustable with respect to a nailing surface. 18. An automatic nailing device for installing roof decking comprising: a frame; a pair of wheels attached to said frame for enabling movement of the frame; a pair of nail guns attached to the frame; pneumatic means for activating the nail guns; a sensor for sensing a distance traveled, said sensor being capable of sending a signal relating to said distance; a microprocessor capable of receiving the signal from said sensor and triggering the pneumatic means in response to receiving the signal; a detector for sensing a metal having a predetermined thickness in a path of the nail guns, said detector capable of sending a signal to the microprocessor to prevent the nail guns from nailing into the metal; and a power source for said microprocessor. 19. The automatic nail fastening device of claim 18 wherein said microprocessor is capable of controlling spacing of nails that are emitted from the nail guns and a pattern for nailing the nails. 20. The automatic nail fastening device of claim 18 further comprising means for feeding nails into the nail guns. 21. The automatic nail fastening device of claim 18 further comprising a pair of handles connected to said frame wherein each of said handles includes a safety lever. 22. The automatic nail fastening device of claim 18 wherein said power source comprises at least one of a battery, a fuel cell, or a solar source. 23. The automatic nail fastening device of claim 18 further comprising at least one push button for manually triggering the pneumatic means. 24. The automatic nail fastening device of claim 18 further comprising means for locating an edge of roof decking. 25. The automatic nail fastening device of claim 18 further comprising a control panel connected to said frame. 26.
