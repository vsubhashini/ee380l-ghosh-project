One embodiment of the present invention sets forth a computer-implemented method for tuning laser scribe parameters during the fabrication of a solar module. The method includes analyzing the visual appearance of a laser scribe to extract various morphological parameters related to the quality of a laser scribe process used to produce the scribe. Based on the morphological parameters, the laser scribe parameters may be modified in-situ to achieve settings that are optimal for performing laser scribing in each layer of the solar module. As a result, laser scribe process cycle time may be minimized while providing better indication of the laser scribe process stability and quality relative to the prior art approaches.
