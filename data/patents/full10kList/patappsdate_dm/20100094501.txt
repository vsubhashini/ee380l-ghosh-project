A system and methods for the automated display of a borderless sun glare block area and sunshield in a windshield, which can be made of electrochromatic glass, in a motor vehicle driven at any time and at any location on earth is presented. The first method, which accurately calculates the precise position of the sun glare block area, is based on the apparent solar position, the direction of travel relative to the true North, the slope of the road, the windshield tilt angle, and the dynamic position of the driver's eyes. It uses sets of different formulas depending on the position of the sun glare on the windshield and the slope of the road. The second method calculates the changing opacities of the borderless sun glare block area, whose opacity decreases from its center to its edge and matches that of the sunshield, based on the ambient light intensity.
