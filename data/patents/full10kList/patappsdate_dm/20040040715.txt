An in situ process for treating a hydrocarbon containing formation is provided. The process may include providing heat from one or more heaters to at least a portion of the formation. The heat may be allowed to transfer from the reaction zone to a part of the formation such that heat from one or more heaters pyrolyzes at least some hydrocarbons within the part of the formation. A blending agent may be produced from the part of the formation, wherein a mixture produced with the blending agent has at least one selected property.
