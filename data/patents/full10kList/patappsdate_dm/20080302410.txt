A solar cell module connector includes an insulating box (2). The insulating box includes a solar cell module lead line connection zone (8) and an output cable connection zone (12) disposed on opposite sides of an diode zone (10), with partitions (4, 6) disposed therebetween, respectively. Heat sinks (14) are disposed in the diode zone, with their first ends located in said solar cell module lead line connection zone and with their second ends located in said output cable connection zone. Connection terminals (26) are connected to the respective ones of the first ends of the heat sinks and extend through the partition (4) into the solar cell module lead line connection zone. Connection terminals (30) are connected to the second ends of the heat sinks disposed at the opposite, first and second outermost locations and extend through the partition (6) into the output cable connection zone. Anodes of chip-type diodes (18) are connected to the respective heat sinks expect one of the two outermost heat sinks, with their cathodes connected to the respective ones of the heat sinks adjacent on the first outermost location side.
Claims 1. A method of producing a solar cell module panel with bypass diodes, comprising the steps of: forming an insulating box including a diode zone, a solar cell module lead line connection zone on one side of said diode zone with a first partition disposed between said solar cell module lead line connection zone and said diode zone, and an output cable connection zone on the other side of said diode zone with a second partition disposed between said output cable connection zone and said diode zone; forming an interim assembly by disposing a series combination of a plurality of diodes in said diode zone, deriving a plurality of lead line connection terminals which respectively extend from opposite ends of said diode series combination and junctions of said serially connected diodes into said solar cell module lead line connection zone, deriving cable connection terminals which extend from the opposite ends of said diode series combination into said output cable connection zone, respectively, and filling said diode zone with an insulating material; conducting characteristic tests of said interim assembly; mounting said interim assembly onto a rear surface of a solar cell module panel; and connecting lead lines of respective solar cell modules of said solar cell module panel to associated ones of said lead line connection terminals, and connecting output cables to said cable connection terminals.
