Embodiments of the invention can provide systems, methods, and an apparatus for converting direct current (DC) power to alternating current (AC) power. According to one embodiment, a system for converting DC power to AC power can be provided. The system can include a DC power source electrically coupled to a DC-to-DC converter. The DC power source can be associated with a first ground, and the DC-to-DC converter can be operable to isolate the power provided by the DC power source from the first ground. The DC-to-DC converter can be further operable to condition the DC power and to provide the conditioned DC power to an inverter. The inverter can receive the conditioned DC power and can convert the conditioned DC power to AC power. The AC power can be associated with a second ground and can be provided to at least one load electrically coupled to the inverter.
