providing a common outlet valve, disposed at said common outlet header, that can be positioned to allow a user to obtain an output of hot or cold purified water from the system; and providing a coffee maker comprising: an inlet to a ground coffee container, the inlet provided with at least one of: hot purified water, or steam, a ground coffee container, and an outlet for liquid coffee; thereby providing a method for making a system for producing air-extracted, purified water and coffee, thereby available for a user to extract via said outlet-release valve. 25. The method of claim 14, wherein: said refrigerant compressor is a controllable, variable-speed, high-efficiency compressor; said refrigerant compressor is controlled by an inverter-controller; said duty cycles and operation of said refrigerant compressor can be user-adjusted at an onboard control panel via said inverter-controller; and a user can program the system to operate said refrigerant compressor at optimum efficiency according to the environmental conditions. 26. The method of claim 14, further comprising the step of providing at least one solar panel having a rated capacity of at least 300 W to electrically power the system. 27. The method of claim 17, further comprising the step of providing at least one solar panel having a rated capacity of at least 300 W to electrically power the system. 28. The method of claim 22, further comprising the step of providing at least one solar panel having a rated capacity of at least 300 W to electrically power the system. 29. The method of claim 24, further comprising the step of providing at least one solar panel having a rated capacity of at least 300 W to electrically power the system. 30. The system of claim 1, further comprising at least one solar panel having a rated capacity of at least 300 W to electrically power the system. 31. The system of claim 3, further comprising at least one solar panel having a rated capacity of at least 300 W to electrically power the system. 32. The system of claim 4, further comprising at least one solar panel having a rated capacity of at least 300 W to electrically power the system. 33. The system of claim 9, further comprising at least one solar panel having a rated capacity of at least 300 W to electrically power the system.
