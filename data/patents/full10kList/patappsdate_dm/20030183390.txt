In an embodiment, a method for heating a hydrocarbon containing formation may include providing heat from one or more heaters to an opening in the formation. A first end of the opening may contact the earth's surface at a first location and a second end of the opening may contact the earth's surface at a second location. The heat may be allowed to transfer from the opening to at least a part of the formation. The transferred heat may pyrolyze at least some hydrocarbons in the formation. In certain embodiments, providing the heat to the opening may include providing heat, heated materials, and/or oxidation products from at least one heater to the opening.
