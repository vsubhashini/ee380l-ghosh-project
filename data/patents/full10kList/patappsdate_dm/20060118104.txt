A method of operating a solar power station solar power station including a solar panel assembly having multiple towers, a solar panel pivotally mounted to an upper end of each tower, and a control system. Each of the towers has multiple floors and is individually extendable from a bottom position to an extended position. The control system includes a main routine for operating the towers comprising a normal operation subroutine for selectively positioning the towers between the bottom position and the extended position, whereby the solar power panel is positioned for maximum solar collection. A monitor parameter subroutine continually monitors the earthquake and wind sensors. A withdraw towers subroutine initiates withdrawal of the towers to the bottom position when the earthquake sensor or the wind sensor sense a seismic event or a high wind force, respectively, that is likely to damage the solar power station. A recover from event subroutine returns control from the withdraw towers subroutine to the normal operation subroutine when the seismic event or high wind force is no longer likely to damage the solar power station.
Claims 1.

The method of claim 1 wherein if the computer check subroutine determines that the computer does not appear to be operating properly, the computer: initiates an alarm or other signal; and initiates computer diagnostics. 3. The method of claim 2 wherein if computer diagnostics verifies that the computer is not operating properly: the computer is placed out of service; the control system is placed in manual control until the computer is repaired; and an operator returns control of the control system to the main routine after the computer is repaired. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein the monitor parameter subroutine: displays the values of any wind or seismic force that is sensed; compares these value of any sensed wind or seismic force to a predetermined setpoint; queries the computer check and maintenance check subroutines to verify that the computer is operating properly and that maintenance is not being performed if the sensed parameter exceeds the setpoint; and initiates an alarm or other signal to alert personnel to manually initiate an appropriate action if the computer is not operating properly or maintenance is being conducted; or initiates a verify parameter subroutine if the computer is operating properly and maintenance is not being conducted, whereby the verify parameter subroutine attempts to determine the proximity of the sensed wind or seismic force. 5. The method of claim 4 wherein if a seismic event has been sensed, the verify parameter subroutine: locates the point of highest wave intensity and the epicenter; determines the distance from the solar power station to the point of highest wave intensity and the epicenter; queries the computer and appropriate personnel to evaluate the intensity of the seismic force to determine the effect on the solar power station; and prompts appropriate personnel to make a manual entry to initiate verifying withdrawal of the towers if the evaluation of the seismic event indicates that the seismic force is likely to damage the solar power station. 6. The method of claim 4 wherein if a high wind force has been sensed, the verify parameter subroutine: locates the source of the wind; determines the direction and intensity of the wind force; prompts appropriate personnel to contact a weather bureau to confirm the direction and intensity of the wind force; queries the computer and appropriate personnel to evaluate the effect of the wind force on the solar power station; and prompts appropriate personnel to make a manual entry to initiate verifying withdrawal of the towers if the evaluation of the wind force indicates that the wind force is likely to damage the solar power station. 7. The method of claim 4 wherein if the proximity of the wind or seismic force cannot be determined, the verify parameter subroutine compares the measured value of the parameter to the setpoint; and exits to a recover from event subroutine if the measured value is less than the setpoint; or attempts to determine the proximity of the wind or seismic force and evaluates the effect of the wind or seismic force if the measured value is greater than the setpoint queries the computer and appropriate personnel to evaluate the effect of the wind force or seismic force on the solar power station; and prompts appropriate personnel to make a manual entry to initiate verifying withdrawal of the towers if the evaluation of the wind or seismic force indicates that the wind force is likely to damage the solar power station; or automatically initiates verifying withdrawal of the towers if the proximity of the wind or seismic force cannot be determined when the measured value is greater than the setpoint. 8. The method of claim 1 wherein the withdraw towers subroutine: initiates an alarm; stops all normal operation of the control system; determines the position of each floor of each tower with respect to a withdrawn position of the floor; and initiates withdrawal of each floor that is not in the withdrawn position. 9. The method of claim 8 wherein the withdraw towers subroutine also: verifies that all of the floors have withdrawn; initiates an alarm if any non-withdrawn floors are detected; and prompts appropriate personnel to manually withdraw non-withdrawn floors that are detected. 10. The method of claim 9 wherein the withdraw towers subroutine further: verifies that all of the floors have withdrawn to a level position; initiates an alarm if any non-level floors are detected; and prompts appropriate personnel to manually level the non-level floors. 11. The method of claim 10 wherein the withdraw towers subroutine further: locks the floors of each tower in the withdrawn position; verifies that all of the floors are locked; initiates an alarm if any unlocked floors are detected; and prompts appropriate personnel to manually lock the unlocked floors. 12. The method of claim 11 wherein the main routine further comprises a recover from event subroutine that: determines the proximity of the seismic event or high wind source; evaluates whether the seismic event or high wind source is sufficiently far away to preclude damage to the solar power station, exits the recover from event subroutine and initiates the verify parameter subroutine if the seismic event or high wind source is not sufficiently far away to preclude damage to the solar power station; compares a measured value of the seismic event or high wind force to a predetermined setpoint and exits the recover from event subroutine to the verify parameter subroutine if the measured value is greater than the setpoint; and if the seismic event or high wind source is sufficiently far away to preclude damage to the solar power station, and the measured value is less than the setpoint, unlocks all of the floors of each tower. 13. The method of claim 12 wherein after floors of each tower are unlocked, the recover from event subroutine also; verifies that all of the floors are unlocked initiates an alarm if any locked floors are detected; prompts appropriate personnel to manually unlock the locked floors; and if the normal operation program is not running, initiates a normal operation program to position the solar power panel, and determines how the solar power panel should be positioned to maximize solar collection. 14.
