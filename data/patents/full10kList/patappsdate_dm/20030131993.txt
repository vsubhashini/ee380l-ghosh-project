An oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. A mixture of hydrocarbons, H.sub.2, and/or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Heat may be applied to the formation to raise a temperature of a portion of the formation to a desired temperature. In some embodiments, the formation to be treated may be selected based on formation characterisitics.
