A solar powered monitor is powered by a photovoltaic solar module. The monitor measures the electrical output from the solar module and records the length of each interval of time during which the electrical output is below a predetermined value. The length of those intervals is accumulated and periodically displayed to determine the operability of the solar module. The module can be used to provide power for surveillance and for other uses.
