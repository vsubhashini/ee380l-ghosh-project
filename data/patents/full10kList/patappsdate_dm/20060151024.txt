A solar cell module includes photoelectric converters, and resin surface covering materials covering the light-incident side of photoelectric converters, trenches being formed in the surface covering materials. The trenches extend approximately in parallel to the horizontal plane for a certain length, and in parallel to each other, so as to facilitate, in repairing the damage therein, improving the adhesiveness between the module surface and the bonding portion of a repair material so as to prevent water and contamination from getting into the bonding portion, prevent the solar cell module properties from deteriorating, prevent any ground fault through the water, and prevent the repair material from peeling.
Claims 1. A solar cell module, comprising: photoelectric converters including a light-incident side surface covered with a surface covering material, the light-incident side surface being formed in a plane having a non-zero angle of tilt with respect to a horizontal plane; trenches in the light-incident side surface, the trenches extending approximately in parallel to the horizontal plane; and the trenches being arranged approximately in parallel to each other in the light-incident side surface. 2. The solar cell module according to claim 1, wherein the trenches have a certain width in a horizontal direction thereof 3. A method for installing a solar cell module including photoelectric converters having a light-incident side surface covered with a surface covering material, the method comprising the steps of: forming trenches of predetermined length in the light-incident side surface; and mounting the solar cell module on a module supporting material such that the trenches extend approximately in parallel to the horizontal plane and in parallel to each other.
