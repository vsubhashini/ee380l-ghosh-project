A two component highly portable and lightweight system for extending the transmission capabilities of Land Mobile Radio systems into areas lacking coverage due to structures, depth below the earth's surface, or varying terrain or other dead zones lacking coverage. The system utilizes the Radio over IP protocol to transfer two-way audio from one radio to another radio for re-broadcast inside a dead zone over a 900 MHz Ethernet-based point-to-point wireless link. The novel system includes RF to TCP/IP conversion and digital data transmission followed by a TCP/IP conversion to RF radio link and provides components and a method for bridging RF radio into dead zones.
