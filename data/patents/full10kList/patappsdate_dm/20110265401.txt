Claims 1. Mounting system for solar modules (6) having a frame (2) on which one or more plate-shaped solar modules (6) are held, wherein the frame (2) is supported on a substructure (7, 9, 11) that is fixed to a subsurface, characterized in that an anchor (13, 35) is provided that can be affixed to a building structure (17) and supports the frame (2) in an upper region, the frame (2) being slidably positioned relative to the anchor (13, 35). 2. Mounting system according to claim 1, characterized in that guiding means (21, 22, 24, 41, 59) are attached at to or formed at the anchor (13, 15), and that the anchor (13, 15) is slidably moveable relative to a profile (3) in its longitudinal direction. 3. Mounting system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the frame (2) comprises upwardly extending profiles (3), and that at least one of these profiles (3) is slidably retained relative to an anchor (13, 35). 4. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the setting range of the profile (3) relative to the anchor (13, 35) amounts to at least 10 cm, preferably more than 1 m or the whole length of the profile. 5. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the frame (2) comprises several upwardly extending profiles (3) connected to each other by means of horizontal profiles (2, 5). 6. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the guiding means (21, 22, 24, 49) provided at the anchor (13, 35) clasp at least partially an upwardly extending profile (3). 7. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the guidance of an upwardly extending profile (3) is provided by means of a slot (32') through which a bolt (41) is inserted. 8. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the anchor (13, 35) is connected to a retainer part (20) that can be adjusted in a horizontal direction relative to a fixed part (35) fixed to a wall (17). 9. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the anchor (13, 35) is connected to a retainer part (58) that can be pivoted about a horizontal and/or vertical axis (53, 56) relative to a fixed part (51) fixed to the wall (17). 10. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the anchor (13, 35) comprises a section that can be inserted into a wall and to which a sealing device (29) is attached in order to seal the wall duct. 11. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the anchor (35', 35'') is constructed to be adjustable in length. 12.
