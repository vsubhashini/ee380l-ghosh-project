A solar battery module capable of assuring the fluid-tight structure of the roof panels adjacent to each other in lateral direction, realizing a weathering between the modules, eliminating a process for providing a seal member between the ends of the modules adjacent to each other, and facilitating an assembly operation, wherein a recessed part extending from the ridge side to the eaves side of the solar battery module is formed at lateral one end thereof, a projected part in the shape of coming into the recessed part is formed at the other end, and a waterproof means for suppressing the rain water invaded onto the upper surface of the projected part from circulating to the lower surface thereof is installed on the projected part in the state of being inserted into the corresponding recessed part of the solar battery module disposed adjacently to the side.
Claims 1-37. (canceled) 38. A method of installing solar battery modules wherein a plurality of solar battery modules are disposed and installed on a main roof structure wherein each solar battery module comprises a solar battery constituting a roofing member and a supporting stand provided on the eaves-side end of the back face of this solar battery module and whereby this solar battery is fixed to the main roof structure, a plurality of these being disposed in mutually adjacent fashion on the main roof structure, in which: a mounting groove that receives the ridge-side end of a solar battery of a solar battery module that is adjacently disposed on the eaves side is formed in said supporting stand, a recessed part that extends along the eaves side from the ridge side is formed in one left or right side end of the solar battery module, a projecting part of a shape that will enter said recessed part is formed on the other side end of a solar battery module and waterproofing means is provided that, in a condition in which said projecting part is inserted into a corresponding recessed part of an adjacently disposed solar battery module at the side, prevents circulation of rainwater invading to the upper surface of this projecting part to the lower surface; comprising; a step of providing water flow checking means that prevents invasion of rainwater covering the gap between these supporting stands extending over both supporting stands of solar battery modules that are adjacently disposed on the left and right sides and linking these supporting stands by these water flow checking means; a step of mounting gaskets formed in a prescribed length in the interiors of a mounting groove in a supporting stand of an already-installed solar battery module such that the joint portion of adjacent ends of the gaskets that are adjacently disposed in the longitudinal direction is positioned corresponding to the upper face of said projecting part of a solar battery module that is adjacently disposed on the eaves side or of a projecting part that is inserted in said recessed part; a step of inserting the ridge-side end of a solar battery of a solar battery module that is adjacently disposed on the eaves side in said gasket; and a step of mounting said projecting part or recessed part of a solar battery module that is adjacently disposed on the eaves side with a corresponding recessed part or projecting part of a solar battery module that is adjacently disposed at the side thereof. 39. The method of installing solar battery modules according to claim 38 comprising a step of arranging sealing members for sealing these joints at the locations where the joint portions of said gasket ends are positioned in said mounting grooves, the separation between their opposite side faces being set to be smaller than the length dimensions of said gaskets and a step of mounting said sealing members by compressing them at both their ends along the length direction of the gaskets by bending deformation of these gaskets by the step of mounting the gaskets in the mounting grooves. 40. The method of installing solar battery modules according to claim 38 wherein said water flow checking means is constituted by a water flow checking metal element which is a metal structural element having durability and the supporting stands of the solar battery modules are mutually electrically connected through these water flow checking metal elements by the step of linking the supporting stands. 41. The method of installing solar battery modules according to claim 40 wherein said water flow check metal element is provided with a slot whereby temporary securing is effected slidably along the longitudinal direction with respect to the supporting stand in a screw securing portion at one end thereof and in a screw securing portion at the other end an open hole that is C-shaped in plan view and that receives the shank of a loosened mounting screw is provided in a supporting stand adjacent to said supporting stand an in the step of linking said supporting stands the screw securing portion of the one end having said slot is fixed after the screw securing portion at the other end has been fixed by a mounting screw received in the open hole by sliding this water flow checking metal element that was temporarily secured in the one supporting stand in said slot.
