The invention relates to photovoltaic solar lampposts with network connection formed by a redimensioned photovoltaic solar panel connected to the electrical network in series with other lampposts of the same type, their connections converging in an inverter with network connection which will be common for a certain and calculated number of lampposts.
Claims 1. Photovoltaic solar lampposts with network connection which are characterized by being formed by a redimensioned photovoltaic solar panel (1), having small dimensions and low power, essentially connected to the electrical network (7) in series with other lampposts (1.1; 1.2; 1.3) of this same type, the connections of all of them converging in an inverter (6) with a network connection (7) which will be common for a certain and calculated number of lampposts (1.1; 1.2; 1.3). 2. The photovoltaic solar lampposts with network connection according to claim 1, wherein the photovoltaic panels are characterized in that they are supported on a post (2), with an articulated joint which will allow orientating and tilting the panel (1) which, in its upper perimeter of the panel (1), has a series of pointed protection elements (3), and contains LED type luminaires which are connected to the electrical network (7) fed by the panels (1) and are attached to the post (2) by a galvanized steel arm (5). 3. The photovoltaic solar lampposts with network connection according to claim 1, wherein the photovoltaic panel is characterized by being formed of monocrystalline or polycrystalline silicon according to each case and will be dimensioned according to the geographic location. 4. The photovoltaic solar lampposts with network connection according to claim 1, wherein the post is characterized in that it has a nodular cast iron base with a steel tube shaft, with variable heights and segments, galvanized by immersion in zinc bath.
