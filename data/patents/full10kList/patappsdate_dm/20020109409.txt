This is the method of controlling the distribution of energy. Energy can be in the form of electrical power, mechanical, hydraulic, gases, shielding from frequencies, communications, computers, liquids, solar energy and the like. Any form of energy that needs to be controlled and distributed. Whatever the requirement for a specific contact, the power energy distribution system, as it rotates from one contact point to another, distributes the specific requirement of energy without imposing a total demand load. The control of the demand load to supply the needs of power is the invention.
Claims What is claimed: 1. Claim 1 claims an invention to control and direct energy from a central point to a distribution point via the use of a power energy distribution system which is operated by a source controller directing power to a power energy distribution system which rotates in a circle and is a contact point which contacts each source of power requirement which the power controller directs to the power energy distribution system that rotates from one demand load or contact point to another around a circle, the invention is that the demand load for a series of any 8 or 10 points or many more in a circle can contact from the center rotor contacting to each point, each point of the center rotor contacts or delivers the power to that requirement from the power energy distribution system; now the controller is a point which is automated and controlled that the power coming to it is the amount of power that would be required for each circuit; the invention is that the power requirement for that specific circuit or energy or whatever rotation to satisfy the use of energy from the controller will satisfy that requirement; the invention also includes the fact that only one of the sources of energy coming from the power controller to the power energy distribution system is going to be used to contact all of the other requirements, the invention is that we take one requirement of energy and distribute it on a rotation of many different points and uses of energy therefore instead of having a demand load from the power controller or source controller we are using only 1 requirement to rotate, contact all of the other requirements; so we have taken one demand load and we have distributed the demand load of all the other demand of power or other sources of power or energy say from 1 to 10, therefore as the rotor rotates, the rotor is rotated to each demand contact point we have diminished 1 times, times whatever times the demand load is required in the rotation; this could be from 1 to 10, 1 to 100 whatever, the speed of the rotation the RPM, the faster it moves from one to another taking away the interruption also in the power control system it has an uninterruptible power system so that when the rotor leaves one point of contact to another the UPS will supply that demand from its storage and will be recharged as the rotor goes from one contact to another, the faster it goes, the less interruption and the UPS will store energy while the rest of the demand load on the rotor going from one to another will restore itself and if there isn't enough source of power to take the power demand say all 10 points, all 8 points demand load immediately as the rotation goes around the rotar takes power from the UPS to supply the UPS for that particular source; we will then take power from another source, a utility or solar system so what we have here is a total backup system and the faster the rotor moves in its orbit, the faster the energy is dispersed and we can reach very high speeds so that one source of power can supply multiple requirements of the same need or more and tap into a UPS system, now we have taken in this invention and described that one source of power that is brought to the power control system which provides the power to the power energy distribution system, it is all programmed on a microprocessor system and a UPS system which can be used for electrical power distribution, for fluids, for gases, for all different applications where energy has to be used and distributed; it enables energy savings and cost savings; this invention will implement said patents referred to in the specification, but not limited to, and will be used for all applications for all applications of the requirements of energy use; refer to FIGS. 1 to 16; 2.
