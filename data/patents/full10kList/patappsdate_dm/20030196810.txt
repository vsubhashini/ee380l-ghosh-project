A method for treating a hydrocarbon containing formation is provided. In one embodiment, heat from one or more heaters may be provided to at least a portion of the formation. Heat may be allowed to transfer from the one or more heaters to at least a part of the formation. In certain embodiments, the heat from the one or more heaters may pyrolyze at least some hydrocarbons in the formation. In an embodiment, a first fluid may be introduced into at least a portion of the formation. The portion may have previously undergone an in situ conversion process. A mixture of the first fluid and a second fluid may be produced from the formation. Such mixture may, in some embodiments, be treated or burned.
