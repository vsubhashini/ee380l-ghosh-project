The invention relates to a solar tracker including a structure formed by means of a plurality of rigid frames formed by pairs of pillars (1 and 2) connected with ties (4) and collaterally with ties forming Saint Andrew's crosses (5), such that those rigid frames which are anchored to the ground through struts (3) driven therein form the mounting support for a corresponding solar panel-supporting grate (6), the latter being mounted with the possibility of pivoting towards one side or the other and being oriented according to the direction of the sun's rays. Those rigid frames with the grates form alignments in which groups are established, wherein the panels of each group are connected with a tubular element forming a connecting rod (13) which is driven by a power unit to transmit the movement, either in a linear manner and converted into a pivoting movement to the grates (6), or in a pivoting manner directly to said grates (6), and achieve the suitable orientation thereof. The transmission of movement is based on a triangular support (9) mounted in the grates (6), those frames (9) receiving the linear or oscillating movement of the connecting rod (13).
Claims 1. A solar tracker, which, being formed from a structure provided with means enabling the orientation with respect to the azimuthal axis of the different solar panel-supporting grates, is characterized in that the structure is formed by means of a plurality of rigid frames in each of which there is mounted a grate (6), forming alignments in the east-west direction, and in each alignment group of rigid frames and grates (6) which are simultaneously driven in movement to achieve the orientation of the different grates and therefore of the solar panels, according to the incidence of the sun's rays; it having been provided that each rigid frame is formed by a north pillar (1) and a south pillar (2) with a bracing of ties (4) between them, and a bracing based on ties (5) in the form of Saint Andrew's crosses, with the contiguous ones, said pillars (1 and 2) being mounted on corresponding struts (3) driven into the ground; with the particularity that the grates (6) are mounted between the pillars (1 and 2) of each rigid frame by means of the interposition of U-shaped parts (8) which are rotatably fixed on respective crosspieces (7) of the grates (6); it having been provided that the oscillation movement towards one side and the other of said grates (6) and therefore the orientation movement thereof towards the suitable incidence of the sun's rays, is performed by means of a power unit based on a geared motor (16-16') at the output of which there has been provided a pinion (17-17') meshing with a rack (18-18') laterally arranged on a tubular element with a circular cross-section acting as a connecting rod (13), common to the different rigid frames and grates (6) of each group, such that the movement generated by the power unit on the connecting rod (13) is transmitted to the grates (6), causing an oscillating movement towards one side or the other thereof. 2. The solar tracker according to claim 1, characterized in that the connecting rod (13) through which the oscillating movement is transmitted to the grates (6) remains fixed in height and is connected with an oscillating support (9) fixed to the corresponding crosspiece (7) of the grate (6), in which pivoting frame (9) there is mounted a guide (11) with a runner (12) to which the connecting rod (13) itself is linked, so that in the shift thereof due to the drive of the power unit that linear movement is transmitted and is converted into an oscillating movement on the frame (9) and therefore on the grate (6), causing the pivoting towards one side and the other thereof. 3. The solar tracker according to claim 2, characterized in that the connecting rod (13), in addition to its linking to the runner (12) mounted in the guide (11) of the triangular and pivoting frame (9), is supported on a support (14) fixed to the south pillar (2), being guided between a pair of pulleys (15) mounted on the support (14). 4. The solar tracker according to claim 2, characterized in that on the connecting rod (13) there is mounted a rack (18) on which a pinion (17) corresponding to the driving geared motor (16) meshes, such that the rotation in one direction or the other of the pinion (17) entails the shift towards one side or the other of the connecting rod (13) and the consequent oscillating movement of the triangular frame (9) to transmit the movement towards one side and the other of the grate (6) itself, the connecting rod (13) being supported in that meshing area on a pair of pulleys (19) which keep it in the position of meshing its rack (18) with the pinion (17) of the geared motor (16). 5. The solar tracker according to claim 1, characterized in that the connecting rod (13) is mounted between a pair of tabs (20) provided in the vertex of a triangular frame (9') fixed to the crosspiece (7) of the south pillar, said connecting rod (13) being connected with a linear actuator (21) formed by a piston driven by a motor mounted on a support (22), establishing an oscillating movement on said connecting rod (13) and the consequent movement on the triangular frame (9') and with it of the grate (6). 6. The solar tracker according to claim 1, characterized in that on the connecting rod (13) there is fixed a rack (18') supported on two pulleys (19') arranged on a lower support (25), and the rack (18') of which meshes with a pinion (17') provided at the output of the geared motor (16'), the latter being mounted such that it can shift in an upward and downward direction on respective guides (23) in which corresponding shoes (24) slide, which shoes form part of the geared motor (16') itself, such that the oscillating movement performed by the connecting rod (13) is accompanied in the vertical movement by the geared motor (16') to achieve transmitting the power to the grate (6), it having been provided that the assembly is mounted on anchor plates (26') with which centering discs (26) collaborate to absorb small deviations in the mounting thereof on the corresponding struts driven into the ground. 7. The solar tracker according to claim 1, characterized in that the connecting rod (13) is connected in an articulated manner with a shoe (27) which is mounted on a support (28) of the south pillar (2) and which shoe (27) includes two ends opposite that for the mounting thereof on the connecting rod (13) which are articulated, through ties (29), to the corresponding crosspiece (7) of the grate (6), such that the shift towards one side and the other of the connecting rod (13) by the drive of the corresponding power unit entails the oscillation in one direction or the other of the rocker (27) and with it the pivoting towards one side or the other of the grate (6) itself. 8. The solar tracker according to claim 3, characterized in that on the connecting rod (13) there is mounted a rack (18) on which a pinion (17) corresponding to the driving geared motor (16) meshes, such that the rotation in one direction or the other of the pinion (17) entails the shift towards one side or the other of the connecting rod (13) and the consequent oscillating movement of the triangular frame (9) to transmit the movement towards one side and the other of the grate (6) itself, the connecting rod (13) being supported in that meshing area on a pair of pulleys (19) which keep it in the position of meshing its rack (18) with the pinion (17) of the geared motor (16).
