A method of launching space vehicles by towing them aloft, then twirling them around a large transport aircraft (40) at the center of a formation (AA) of other tow aircraft (28, 34) and other devices of the invention. A lengthy, semi-rigid tow pipeline (14) serves as a conduit for the transfer of fuels and oxidizers, as the tow cable, and as an energy storage device that reflexes efficiently when it is flexed. The flexing of tow pipeline (14) is caused by a parachute (22) acting in conjunction with all the aircraft making the tighest turn they are capable of doing. Tow aircraft in certain arrays (28) are joined to tow pipeline (14) by sliding trollies (26) that also host canard rotor wings for the aerodynamic support of the main tube (12). The tow trollies (26) aid the sliding tow aircraft arrays (28) in gaining mechanical advantage to accelerate the space vehicle. The space vehicle may also burn its own motors for a longer-than-usual time as it gains in angular velocity because its fuels are replenished by a pipeline that automatically increases the pressure and volume of fuel flow as the angular acceleration increases. The tow pipeline (14) features a micro-hole laminar lift foil (50) on the top surface of the wing and on the bottom. By balancing the vacuum level in the plurality of chamber underneath the plurality of lift foil 50, the pilot or autopilot has an effective way to control the flight characteristics of the tow pipeline (14). In some embodiments the micro-hole laminar lift foil (50) on the top and bottom will made of transparent hollow wire segments or other material so arranged as to pass ambient light through to photo-voltaic cells below that convert sunlight to electrical energy.
