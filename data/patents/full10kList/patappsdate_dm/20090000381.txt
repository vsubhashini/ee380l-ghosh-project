A system is disclosed for detecting and locating harmful impacts to pipelines using sensors placed along the pipeline. The exact spacing of sensors is site specific and is set with the goal of maximizing sensor spacing without reducing system performance and reliability. At each sensor location, preferably there are four basic components, i.e., a hydrophone, solar power components, and data processing and communications equipment. Each hydrophone directly measures the acoustic noise fluctuation in a pipe section, which propagates at long distances in the pipeline at the specific speed of sound for the particular type of pipe. If specific signal parameters exceed a programmed threshold, a detection message is generated and transmitted via a communications link to a central monitoring and diagnostic center.
