A warning light relates to a light device that can be affixed to a vehicle and emits glaring light to give alert, specifically to a warning light, of which the power is converted from solar energy and a vibration sensor module activates a light module to emit light. The light emission is made every second and each of which lasts for one minute so as to give glaring light, which maximizes alert effectiveness.
Claims 1. A warning light, which uses solar energy to emit light for giving alert, comprises: a mounting; a receptacle, which fits on said mounting and comprises a hole, an opening, a plurality of pins formed on lengthwise sides and buttons formed on outer edge: said hole for ensconcing a battery; said opening for inlaying a circuit board, on which a light module and a vibration sensor module are installed; a solar energy receiver, which is mounted on the circuit board, near to the light module; and a covering, which comprises a plurality of button holes in which the receptacle's buttons can fit so as to make the covering and the receptacle close together. 2. The warning light of claim 1, wherein a double-sided tape may adhere to one side of the mounting. 3. The warning light of claim 1, wherein anchoring pins may be installed on the other side of the mounting. 4. The warning light of claim 1, wherein the light module is a LED module.
