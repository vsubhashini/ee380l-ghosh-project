The portable illuminated real estate sign system consists of a carrying case, a sign, and a post. This solar powered illuminated sign is attached to a detachable post that has an anti-theft device. An accompanying bag is used for ease of transport and storage. The sign can be single- or double-sided, having a weatherproof casing, a plastic transparent front and back, and a hinged door to allow signage to be easily changed. Within the sign casing is a solar panel that collects solar energy to charge at least one rechargeable battery, energizing light sources to be turned on by a light sensor from dusk till dawn.
Claims 1. A portable illuminated real estate sign system comprising: a) an illuminated sign comprising a weather resistant case made of a rigid plastic material said casing consisting a rectangular frame having a front side a back side and four edge sides all of which are joined together, wherein said front side and back side is a transparent plastic material; and b) on one side of said casing is a female groove assembly; and c) within said casing spaced apart at a predetermine distance in parallel fashion behind said transparent front and back side is a plurality of slots made of a transparent material; and d) said slots to support a plurality of transparency advertisements; and e) spaced apart at a predetermine distance in parallel fashion behind said plurality of slots is a translucent panel; and f) sandwiched between said translucent panels is a plurality of light sources to illuminate said translucent panels; and g) a solar panel incorporated in said casing in parallel position with respect to one of the four edge sides, for collecting solar energy; and h) a rechargeable battery electrically connected to said solar panel in a manner to recharge said battery; and said plurality of light sources being electrically connected to said battery whereby to illuminate the name plate; and i) a light sensor within said case sensing a level of ambient light, said light sensor permitting current from said battery to energize said plurality of light sources when said sensed level of ambient light is below a predetermined level, and j) on another side of said casing is a hinge door with a first hasp assembly at the opposite end said door can open to a 90 degree position and returns to a 90 degree resting position. 2. A single sided portable illuminated comprising: a) a weather resistant case made of a rigid plastic material said casing consisting a rectangular frame having a front side a back side and four edge sides all of which are joined together, wherein said front side is a transparent plastic material; and b) said back side is solid material and having a plurality of mounting members, and said mounting members, for mounting said case to a surface; and c) on one side of said casing is a female groove assembly; and d) within said casing spaced apart at a predetermine distance in parallel fashion behind said transparent front is a plurality of slots made of a transparent material; and e) said slots to support a plurality of transparency advertisements; and f) spaced apart at a predetermine distance in parallel fashion behind said plurality of slots is a translucent panel; and g) behind said translucent panels is a plurality of light sources to illuminate said translucent panel; and h) a solar panel incorporated in said casing in parallel position with respect to one of the four edge sides, for collecting solar energy; and h) a rechargeable battery electrically connected to said solar panel in a manner to recharge said battery; and said plurality of light sources being electrically connected to said battery whereby to illuminate the name plate; and i) a light sensor within said case sensing a level of ambient light, said light sensor permitting current from said battery to energize said plurality of light sources when said sensed level of ambient light is below a predetermined level, and j) on another side of said casing is a hinge door with a first hasp assembly at the opposite end said door can open to a 90 degree position and returns to a 90 degree resting position. 3. The illuminated sign of claim 1 and 2, whereby said the plurality of light sources are bright white light emitting diodes. 4. A portable and detachable post comprising: a) a plurality of support members having coupling means whereby said members can be connected in series to form a real estate standard consisting: a semi-hollow vertical member with a ground stake shape at one end, and a male insertion at the other end, and containing at least a hole assembly and said hole assembly allows the user a place to apply foot pressure to drive said member into the ground; and b) a plurality of hollow vertical member having a female insertion at one end and a male insertion at the other end, and containing at least one hole assembly, member can slidably fit into said semi-hollow vertical member, said hole allows the user a place to apply hand pressure to assist in driving said hollow vertical member combined with said semi-hollow vertical member into the ground; and c) a upper section of the post is a combination of a semi-hollow vertical member and a horizontal member attached at a 90 degree angle, said semi-hollow vertical member contains at least one hole and female insertion that can slidably fit into said hollow vertical member, said horizontal member consists of a male groove assembly, this allows said casing with said female groove assembly to slidably fit into said horizontal member, said horizontal member consists of a second hasp assembly, once the first hasp assembly and the second hasp assembly are facing each other at a 90 degree angle, a padlock can be used to secure the casing to said horizontal member. 5. A carrying bag comprising: a bag member, said bag member having a base portion, transparent plastic front portion, back, and side portions and a top portion, all being constructed of flexible material, said bag member having a closure mechanism proximate to said top portion, and further being provided with handles proximate to the top portion of said bag member, and an adjustable handle proximate to the back portion of said bag member.
