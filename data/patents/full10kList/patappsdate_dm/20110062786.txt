An electric power generating system includes a plurality of variable power sources including at least one source of DC power and at least one source of AC power. Converters convert power supplied by the plurality of power sources to a common source of power to be communicated to a collector bus. A power grid supplies three-phase power to components requiring three-phase power downstream of the collector bus. Converters provide three phases of power to the power bus from the collector bus.
