Solar energy system incorporating a dirigible motor-driven collector and an electronic sensor for turning the collector to follow the sun. The collector is turned progressively during the day to occupy successive positions during predetermined time periods in which it collects solar energy most efficiently, at the end of the day automatically returning the solar collector to its initial, morning position. The system is controlled by an arrangement which is composed largely of a novel combination of commercially available units, thereby cutting its cost and increasing its reliability.
