A solar power station for providing illumination or a signal generally including a storage battery-powered signaling element, a solar generator for recharging the storage battery and a bracket assembly for supporting the remainder of the components. The bracket assembly is lightweight and supports the solar generator in an orientation to provide adequate exposure to ambient light in a wide variety of sun positions. The signaling element is disposed substantially above the solar generator in order to minimize obstructions therebetween. The apparatus is adapted to be self-contained, to be independent in operation, and to be left unattended for substantial periods of time.
Claims I claim: 1. In a self-contained signaling apparatus having an electrically-operable signal element and a storage battery for supplying electrical energy to said signal element, the improvement comprising in combination: solar electric generator means connectable to said storage battery for converting ambient light to electrical energy and for recharging said battery, said solar electric generator means including a number of photoelectric cells electrically connected to said storage battery; enclosure means for enclosing said solar generator means, said enclosure means including an outer panel portion composed of a substantially transparent material for allowing said ambient light to pass therethrough to said solar generator means; a bracket assembly for supporting said enclosure means in a relationship therewith such that said transparent upper portion faces in a generally upward and horizontally outward direction relative to said bracket assembly, said bracket assembly including mounting means adapted for mounting said signal apparatus thereon, said mounting means being positioned substantially above said solar generator means in order to substantially minimize the obstruction of said ambient light from striking said solar generator means and to maximize visibility of said signal apparatus, said bracket assembly further including a number of spike-like members protruding in a substantially upward direction therefrom in order to discourage birds or the like from perching on said bracket assembly; and means adapted for enclosing and attaching said storage battery to said bracket assembly. 2. The improvement according to claim 1, wherein said bracket assembly includes a first bracket portion and a second bracket portion, said first bracket portion including at least one generally vertically upstanding member, said second bracket portion including at least one generally horizontally extending member attached to said upstanding member, said enclosure means being attached to said first and second bracket portions in a generally transverse relationship therewith. 3. The improvement according to claim 1, wherein said enclosure means further includes a frame generally surrounding said solar generator means and an inner panel portion, said inner and outer panel portions being attached to said frame on oppostie respective inner and outer sides of said photoelectric cells. 4. The improvement according to claim 1, further comprising a storage battery enclosure secured to said brcket assembly and being adapted for receiving said storage battery therein, said storage battery enclosure further being adapted to receive lock means thereon in order to substantially prevent unauthorized access to said storage battery. 5. The improvement according to claim 1, further comprising control means for regulating the recharging current supplied to said storage battery from said solar generator means. 6. A solar power station for a self-contained signaling apparatus having an electrically-operable signaling element powered by a storage battery, said solar power station comprising in combination: a solar generator including a number of photoelectric cells electrically connected to said storage battery for converting ambient light to electrical energy in order to recharge said storage battery, the number of said photoelectric cells being substantially greater than that needed to recharge said storage battery in order to be capable of recharging said storage battery even while said solar generator is partially obstructed from the ambient light, enclosure means for enclosing said solar generator, said enclosure means including a peripheral frame generally surrounding said storage battery, inner and outer panels spaced apart on opposite sides of said solar generator and secured to said peripheral frame, at least said outer panel being substantially transparent in order to expose said photoelectric cells to said ambient light; a bracket assembly including a first bracket portion and a second bracket portion, said first bracket portion including a pair of spaced-apart generally vertical upstanding legs interconnected at their upper ends by a generally horizontally extending crossmember, said peripheral frame of said enclosure means being secured to each of said upstanding legs at a location between their upper and lower ends, said second bracket portion including a pair of spaced-apart generally horizontally extending base members, each of said base members being secured to said peripheral frame of said enclosure means and to the lower end of one of said upstanding legs, said enclosure means for said solar generator being disposed at an approximately 45 degree angle relative to said generally horizontal base members, said horizontally extending cross-member having spike-like protruberances thereon, said spike-like protruberances protruding substantially upwardly from at least said cross-member in order to discourage birds or other animals from perching on said cross-member and thereby obstructing the incidence of ambient light onto said solar generator; a housing adapted for receiving said storage battery therein, said housing being secured to at least one of said base members; mounting means secured to said cross-member and being adapted for mounting said signaling element thereon said cross-member and said mounting means being disposed a substantial distance above said enclosure means in order to minimize the obstruction of ambient light by said first bracket portion and said signaling element; means for electrically connecting said storage battery to said signaling element at predetermined times; and control means for regulating the recharging current supplied to said storage battery from said solar generator. 7. A solar power station according to claim 6, wherein said housing is secured to both of said base members and is disposed between said base members at a position generally beneath said enclosure means. 8. A solar power station according to claim 6, wherein said spaced-apart base members are secured to respective spaced-apart upstanding leg members at substantially right angles therewith.
