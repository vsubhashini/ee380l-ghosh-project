A method and apparatus for mounting solar panels is provided. Preferably, the apparatus includes a base, a solar panel receiving structure, and a support structure coupling the base to the solar panel receiving structure such that the solar panel receiving structure is at least one of elevated and angled relative to the base. The solar panel receiving structure preferably includes a base member, a first side member coupled to the base member, and a second side member coupled to the base member. Preferably, the first side member and the second side member are slotted so as to slidably receive at least one solar panel between the first side member, the second side member, and the base member.
Claims 1. A method of mounting solar panels, comprising: sliding at least one solar panel into a solar panel receiving structure; elevating the solar panel receiving structure from a base; and positioning the base on a surface, the base having a sufficient weight to retain the base on the surface without fixing the base to the surface. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising angling the solar panel receiving structure relative to the base. 3. The method of claim 2, wherein an angle between a plane of the base and a plane of the solar panel receiving structure is not greater than about 45.degree.. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein a plurality of solar panels are slid into the solar panel receiving structure. 5. The method of claim 1, further comprising at least one of adjusting a width and a length of the solar panel receiving structure to accommodate differently sized solar panels. 6. A solar panel receiving structure, comprising: means for slidably retaining a plurality of solar panels; means for adjustably elevating and angling the means for slidably retaining relative to a surface; and means for retaining on the surface the means for adjustably elevating and angling.
