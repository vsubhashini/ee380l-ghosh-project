The convertible, modular tri-mode solar conversion system provides two primary heating modes, -both hot water and hot air for winter time operation, with conversion to one secondary mode for electric power generation and air conditioning during summertime operation. The tri-mode solar conversion system utilizes linear parabolic concentrators for converting solar energy to hot water/steam, hot air, and heat engine/electric power generation for nearly all year round operation with improved overall cost-effectiveness. Wintertime hot water is provided within a conventional focal piping line with hot air produced through a thin plastic duct which is concentric to the focal piping. The thin plastic duct is supported by thin, spirally wound wire coils with uniformly located, radial struts fastened to both the focal piping and the wire coils. Summertime air conditioning and electric power are provided from both the focal piping steam and the hot air flow by way of a simple Rankine cycle heat engine loop.
