A solar collector is designed for use in the window opening of a house and also serves to retain the window function for the occupants of the house. The collector has a rectangular frame having an inner pane of glass, an outer pane or panes and a plurality of rotatable louvers mounted in the frame between the inner and outer panes. The louvers have a reflective material on one side and a dark or solar absorbing surface on the other, thereby allowing the proper side to be rotated into position depending on the season. A heated chamber is provided within the louvers so that the working fluid may flow directly through the louvers and allow the heat transfer to occur therein.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A window blind type solar collector for mounting and use as a window and usable with a working fluid as the heat transfer source, comprising: a frame having a top and bottom and first and second sides, said frame including outlet and inlet manifolds along said first and second sides, respectively, through which the working fluid may flow during operation; a first pane of transparent material mounted in said frame; a second pane of transparent material mounted in said frame, parallel to said first pane and spaced from said first pane; and a plurality of louvers rotatably mounted between said first and second sides of said frame, each said louver including: first and second ends positioned closely adjacent said first and second sides of said frame, each louver including a pair of substantially parallel, spaced apart edges extending between said first and second ends and each louver further including upper and lower sides with each louver side extending continuously in fluid tight relationship between said ends and said edges to define a louver wall; an inlet opening at said first end of said louver and an outlet opening at said second end of said louver; each of said inlet and outlet openings being of a predetermined cross sectional area; each said louver including an interior working fluid channel permitting the working fluid to have direct contact with said louver wall within said channel while flowing through said channel, said channel communicating with said inlet and outlet openings and said channel extending between said first and second ends and between said spaced apart edges and said upper and lower sides with said working fluid channel having a substantially larger cross sectional area than said cross sectional area of said inlet and outlet openings so the said channel fills each said louver to significantly increase heat transfer thereto; said inlet and outlet openings connected to communicate with said inlet and outlet manifolds, respectively; and means for rotating said plurality of louvers and interior working fluid channels in unison through at least 360.degree. and maintaining said louvers substantially parallel to one another including: a gear attached to each of said louvers adjacent said frame first sides; and a plurality of idler gears rotatably mounted to said frame first sides, each of said idler gears being located between and engaged with two adjacent louver gears. 2. The solar collector of claim 1 and further including rotation accommodating sealing means between said inlet manifold and said inlet and between said outlet mainfold and said outlet to seal the working fluid while permitting rotation of said louver relative to said manifold. 3. The solar collector of claim 2 wherein each of said louvers also includes an elongated, resiliently bendable lip fixed to and extending from one of said louver edges and overlappping an edge of an adjacent rotatable louvers during rotation of said louvers to close any space between adjacent louvers while resiliently bending to permit continuous rotation of said louvers.
