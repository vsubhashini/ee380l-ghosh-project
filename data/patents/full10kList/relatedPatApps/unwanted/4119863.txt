The combined high density solar panels and vertical wind turbines consist of multiple solar panels with closely spaced solar cells on both sides which are supported by an open framework and vertical posts. The adoption of an elevated, rooftop solar panel array, supported by vertical posts makes the basic structure attractive for the inclusion of multiple vertical wind turbines, as a supplementary power source. This combined natural power conversion arrangement is intended for mounting on the flat roofs of city buildings and other similar flat, limited area sites. Each solar panel is pivoted within the open framework to follow the sun's excursion relative to the earth, and the solar cells on the panel underside receive the solar energy by way of thin edge reflectors secured to both sides of the solar panels, for a high density exposure configuration. A washing spray provision is included for the panel array, to keep the panels clean and operation at optimum efficiencies.
