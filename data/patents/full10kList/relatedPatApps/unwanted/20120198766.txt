A method for adaptive reuse of historic buildings for high density organic agriculture reutilizes historic properties with opaque walls. The method creates environmentally controlled plant growing chambers within a retrofitted historic structure that reduces logistics costs and negative environmental impacts while improving the quality of herbs, fruits, vegetables, and other organic products. The method grows products closer to consumers and with a year round production capability. The present invention collects light for plants, delivers water and nutrients to plants, monitors and adjusts the temperature and humidity of the growing chamber, allows for harvesting of the plants, and recycles materials. The method promotes plant growth in a historic structure that may otherwise not support agriculture within a darkened old building.
Claims 1. A method for adaptive reuse of historic buildings for high density organic agriculture, comprising: delivering light within at least one historic building; supplying plants in a growing media within the at least one historic building; providing an aqueous nutrient solution to the plants; monitoring the growth of the plants and adjusting the conditions within the at least one historic building; harvesting the plants; and, recycling water, nutrient solution, and growing media; wherein said method products saleable plant based products within at least one historic building. 2. The adaptive reuse method of claim 1 wherein said delivering light includes solar collectors and artificial lighting wherein said delivering light occurs regardless of weather conditions exterior of said at least one historic building. 3. The adaptive reuse method of claim 1 further comprising: said adjusting the conditions including systems for heating, cooling, humidity, ventilation, and nutrient delivery.
