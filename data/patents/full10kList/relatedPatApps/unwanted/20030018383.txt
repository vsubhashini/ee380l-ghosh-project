A vision prosthesis includes a lens having an index of refraction that varies in response to a focusing stimulus. An actuator in communication with the lens provides the focusing stimulus on the basis of a range estimate from a rangefinder. A controller coupled to the rangefinder and to the actuator causes the actuator to generate a focusing stimulus on the basis of the range estimate.
