A solar power supply system for providing alternating current for energizing an alternating current appliance from energy derived from solar power. The solar power supply system includes a plurality of photovoltaic cells electrically connected to a battery and a power inverter for converting direct current into alternating current. The power inverter is electrically connected to at least one electrical receptacle to supply alternating current to the electrical receptacle. A second alternating current supply is also electrically connected to the electrical receptacle. A switch electrically connects the power inverter to the electrical receptacle in a first mode and electrically connecting the second alternating current supply to the electrical receptacle in a second mode. A voltage comparator is electrically connected to the photovoltaic cells to compare a predetermined reference voltage to the direct current supply by the photovoltaic cells. The voltage comparator is also electrically connected to the switch. The switch is in the first mode when the voltage comparator detects the direct current supply from the photovoltaic cells is greater than the predetermined reference voltage. The switch is in the second mode when the voltage comparator detects the direct current supply from the photovoltaic cells is less than the predetermined reference voltage.
