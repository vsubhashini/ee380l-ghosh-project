Junction box for connecting plug members to two discrete bus bars in a solar module comprises a dielectric housing which is mounted on the module over tabs connected to respective bus bars. Housing has a pair of integral dielectric receptacle members having terminal members therein having planar blade portions which are engaged by plug members inserted in the receptacles. Terminals each have planar bus terminating portion parallel to floor of housing over aperture in floor which receives tabs therethrough.
Claims I claim: 1. A junction box for mounting on a photovoltaic solar module, said junction box providing means for connecting plug members to two discrete bus bars in said solar module, said junction box comprising: a dielectric housing having a floor, opposed first and second endwalls, and opposed first and second sidewalls, said floor having a planar external surface for mounting flush onto a solar module, said floor having aperture means for receiving connecting means attached to respective bus bars, first and second dielectric receptacle members integral with said first endwall of said housing, each said receptacle member having a profiled axial bore therethrough, the axis of said bore being parallel to said floor of said housing, first and second conductive terminal members having planar blade portions situated in the bores of respective receptacle members and planar bus terminating portions situated in said housing parallel to said floor over said aperture means, each said blade portion being in a plane perpendicular to the respective said bus terminating portion, said axis of each said bore lying parallel to the planes of both the bus terminating portion and the blade portion therein, whereby, said bus terminating portions may be connected to said connecting means when said planar external surface of said housing is fixed to said module with said connecting means extending through said aperture means, said blade portions being connectable to terminals in plug members profiled to fit in said axial bores.
