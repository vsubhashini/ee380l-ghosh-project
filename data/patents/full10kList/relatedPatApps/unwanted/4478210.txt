A self-cooling solar forced air heating collector module, and method of constructing a plurality of the same in modularized array from standarized components, for a solar heating system. The collector has an inner heating compartment beneath an inner glazing, and an outer heating compartment between the inner glazing and an outer glazing. A forced air inlet duct enters the collector bottom surface and communicates directly only with the outer compartment at a given location longitudinally of the collector. An always-open passage effects air flow communication from the outer to the inner compartment, at one longitudinal end thereof remote from the inlet duct. A sole outlet duct extends through the bottom surface and communicates directly only with said inner compartment in the vicinity of the inlet duct. A black body absorber comprising an air-permeable single layer screen extends within the inner compartment such that the forced air flows along and in the same direction on both sides of the screen. The collector is oriented in operation for solar incidence transverse to the glazings with its lengthwise dimension horizontal and its width dimension tilted at an angle between 10.degree. through 90.degree. from horizontal. Upon cessation of forced air flow via the ducts, whereupon a stagnation condition occurs in the collector, the air trapped therein automatically circulates within the collector and to and from the compartments via the always-open passage in response to solar-incidence-induced convection currents, thereby producing a self-cooling action.

The collector array as set forth in claims 5 or 39 wherein said inlet and outlet ducts are disposed centrally longitudinally of the collector array to provide a center feed of said fluid medium and constructed such that the inlet flow divides and flows horizontally in opposite directions through the interconnected outer compartments and then flows into the interconnected inner compartments via two of said passage means. 41. The collector array as set forth in claims 5 or 39 wherein said trusses comprise roof supports of a building structure and said sheathing material comprises a layer of roof sheathing supported above as well as on said trusses and a layer of aluminum sheet sheathing superimposed on said layer of roof sheathing and defining said reflective bottom surface. 42. The solar collector construction set forth in claim 6 wherein said screen comprises a single layer of metallic warp and woof elements woven into a thin, flexible open mesh screen having a natural irregular, somewhat wavy contour, said screen being made up in long and narrow lengths and having a retainer clamp strip secured to each longitudinal edge thereof, and means suspending said screen via said clamp strip approximately in the middle of said inner compartment in generally parallel relation to said inner glazing means and said bottom surface. 43. The solar collector set forth in claim 42 wherein said suspension means comprises a series of spring clips made of corrosion-resistant low thermal conductivity material such as stainless steel to provide tensioning and support for said screen while reducing heat transfer from said screen via said clips. 44. The collector system as set forth in claim 8 further including on each of said beams a pair of longitudinally extending hook flanges spaced laterally from one another and protruding from each said collector interior side of said web in the space between said top and intermediate flanges adapted to individually receive in nested hooked relation the free end edges of a C-shaped retainer channel for holding down the associated inner glazing panel 45. The collector system as set forth in claim 44 further including on each of said beams a black body mounting flange extending along and protruding from each said collector interior side of said web between said intermediate and bottom flanges and at an acute angle adjacent said intermediate flange, each said mounting flange having a lip along its free edge and being adapted to capture in the space defined between said intermediate and mounting flanges a suspension means for the associated black body absorber means of said solar collector. 46. The collector set forth in claims 6, 42 or 43 wherein said collector is oriented in operation for solar incidence transverse to the plane defined by the length and width dimensions of said collector and with its lengthwise dimension extending generally horizontally. 47. The collector set forth in claim 46 wherein said module is oriented in operation with its width dimension extending at an angle in the range of approximately 10.degree. to and including 90.degree. from horizontal. 48. The collector as set forth in claims 6, 42, 43 or 7 wherein said inlet and outlet ducts are disposed centrally longitudinally of the collector to provide a center feed of said fluid medium and constructed such that the inlet flow divides and flows horizontally in opposite directions through the outer compartment and then flows into the inner compartment via two of said gaps disposed one at each of the opposite longitudinal ends of said inner glazing means and an associated end wall of the collector, the flow from said gaps thence returning towards one another to the outlet duct via the inner compartment and said absorber means therein. 49. The black body as set forth in claim 29 or 32 wherein said warp elements comprise relatively narrow and thin flat strips and said woof elements comprise round wire, the maximum thickness of said elements being in the order of 0.011 inches. 50. The collector as set forth in claim 37 wherein said outer and inner glazing means each comprise a plurality of solar transparent lites arranged in an end-to-end trandem array with each pair of the mutually abutting longitudinal ends of the outer and inner glazing lites being respectively supported by exterior and interior struts extending widthwise of the collector, each of said exterior struts being offset longitudinally of the collector from an associated interior strut. 51. The modular solar heat collector system as set forth in claims 44, 45 or 8 wherein said sill, head and intermediate beams are provided in two nominal size lengths of 16 feet and 24 feet, said jambs and said vertical struts are provided in one nominal 4 foot length size, said inner and outer glazing panels all having the same width of nominally 4 feet and being provided in three length sizes of nominally 4 foot, 6 feet, and 8 feet, and including inlet air manifold duct weldments comprising a plate adapted to lay in tandem edge-to-edge abutment with the inner glazing array, said manifolds being provided in two sizes, one size having a nominal foot and a half width and the other size having a nominal three foot width, said two manifold sizes having the same length adapted to span between facing horizontal beams, the narrower width manifold serving as an end feed manifold and the wider manifold serving as a center feed manifold.
