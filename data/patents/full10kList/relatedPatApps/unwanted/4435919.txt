One or more side by side cylinders of light transmitting material are mounted for rotation about their axes within a building structure wall opening or the like. The cylinders each bear internally a narrow panel of thermal insulation material such as polystyrene which extends diametrically across the cylinder from one side to the other. The cylinders are mounted for rotation about their axes such that the thermal insulation panels may be aligned and in the plane of the opening to prevent both light and heat transmission from the exterior of the wall of the interior of the building structure. A half cylinder of slightly larger size may surround each cylinder, is fixedly mounted to the building wall to provide at least exteriorly a double glazed wall for increased protection against thermal loss, particularly when the cylinders are rotated such that the insulation panels are at some angle to the plane of the wall opening.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An integrated window and thermal shutter assembly for closing a rectangular opening within a building wall or the like to permit controlled passive solar heating of a building interior, said assembly comprising: a closed end elongated cylinder mounted for rotation about its axis within said window opening and in the plane of said rectangular opening, said cylinder being sized to said rectangular opening and said cylinder being formed of a sheet of light transmissive material, and an opaque, relatively thick rectangular panel of thermal insulation material mounted internally of said cylinder and spanning diametrically across said cylinder to separate the interior of said cylinder into two dead air spaces; whereby, rotation of said cylinder to a position with the thermal insulation material panel parallel to the plane of said rectangular opening results in complete blockage of light and thermal energy from the building exterior to the building interior and vice versa while, rotation to an angularly displaced position therefrom permits selectively light and thermal radiation to enter the interior of the building, or leave the same. 2. The integrated window and thermal shutter assembly as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a half cylinder of light transmissive sheet material fixedly mounted across said window opening on the exterior of and being spaced slightly from the face of said cylinder and being sized thereto, and means for wipe sealing said half cylinder about its edges relative to said cylinder to form a thin annular dead air space and a double glased window with said cylinder. 3. The integrated window and thermal shutter assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein said panel comprises a thermal insulation material core of relatively high "R" factor, with a light reflective metal foil covering the outer surface of said core. 4. The integrated window and thermal shutter assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein said panel comprises a thermal insulation core of relatively high "R" factor, with a light reflective metal foil covering the outer surface of said core. 5. The integrated window and thermal shutter assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein said means for sealing the ends of said half cylinder comprise sector shaped end pieces of semi-circular form fixed at their peripheries to respective ends of said half cylinder, and wherein said cylinder comprises circular disc end pieces sealably fixed at their peripheries to respective axial ends of said cylinder to close off said elongated cylinder ends, and wherein said sector shaped end pieces include inclined slots projecting inwardly from straight edges thereof and wherein axles project axially outwardly from the centers of said circular disc end pieces of said cylinder and are received within said slots and form said means for mounting said cylinders for rotation about their axis and within the plane of said rectangular opening. 6. The integrated window and thermal shutter assembly as claimed in claim 5, wherein said means for wipe sealing said half cylinder concentric to said such cylinder comprises a gasket fixed to all four edges of the half cylinder and bearing on the periphery of the coaxial cylinder such that said cylinder rotates on said gaskets with rubbing surface contact to form an annular sealed space between said half cylinders and the outer periphery of said cylinders during rotation of said cylinder about its axis. 7. An integrated window and thermal shutter assembly for closing off a rectangular opening within a building wall or the like, said wall comprising intersecting, opposed vertical and horizontal studs mounted within said rectangular wall opening, a plurality of cross studs extending across said opening at laterally spaced positions to form rectangular segments within said opening bounded by said studs, a plurality of half cylinders of light transmissive material having diametrically opposed longitudinal edges fixedly and sealably mounted to said studs defining said window opening segments, sector shaped end pieces, said half cylinders being sealably mounted at respective ends, to the circumferential edge of said sector shaped end pieces, compressible material gasket strip extending along said and overlying opposed longitudinal edges of said half cylinder and aligned edge of said sector shaped end pieces, closed end elongated cylinders formed of light transmissive material mounted for rotation about their axes within said window opening segments and coaxially within half cylinders, said cylinders being of a diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of said half cylinders and forming with said half cylinders a double glazed light transmissive outer wall and a single glazed light transmissive inner wall, relatively thick opaque thermal insulation panels of rectangular form mounted interiorly of said cylinder and extending diametrically from one side of said cylinder to the other and being fixed thereto to rotate therewith; whereby, rotation of said cylinders such that said thermal insulation panels are positioned in line with the plane of the window opening within each segment, prevents light impingement and thermal radiation from the outside of the building to the interior thereof, while rotation of respective cylinders to angularly displaced positions therefrom selectively permits thermal and light radiation internally of said building wall through said light transmissive half cylinders and cylinders. 8. The integrated window and thermal shutter assembly as claimed in claim 7, wherein said thermal insulation panels comprise a rectangular core of a relatively high R thermal insulation material, wooden strips fixed to the edges of said core, means for rigidly connecting opposed longitudinal edges of said panels to diametrically opposite sides of said cylinders and wherein reflective metal foil covers the major faces of said insulation material core on opposite sides thereof to enhance thermal and light radiation through said cylinder by reflecting said radiation from the sides of said thermal insulation panels, when said cylinder is in a position other than one in which the panel is coplanar with the plane of the window opening.
