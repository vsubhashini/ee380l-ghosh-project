A multilayer solar collector structure wherein internal ducting to properly channel fluid flow of the collection medium is integrally provided within the internal layer design. First, second and third insulation layers are included with the first and third serving to sandwich the second therebetween. The second layer is shaped so that it defines an inner hollow core area between the first and third layers so that air from the building is drawn through an inlet which is in communication with that hollow inner core area. A blackened wire mesh adsorber is provided between the top of the third or uppermost layer and a transparent cover and that third layer includes an opening at one end in communication with the hollow core area thereunder and another opening at the opposite end in communication with an exit or exhaust opening. Thus, air can flow from the building into the collector, through the hollow core, the adsorber mesh and returned to the building.
Claims What I claim is: 1. A solar collector for directly heating the air going to a building comprised of frame means including side and bottom walls for enclosing the collector along those wall areas, said bottom wall including means defining two spaced apart openings adjacent one end for allowing air to respectively enter and exit the collector, a first insulation layer engaging the interior of said bottom wall and provided with means defining two spaced apart openings in alignment with each of the openings in the bottom wall, a second insulation layer positioned on said first insulation layer having means defining two spaced apart openings at one end in alignment with each of the openings in said first insulation layer, one of said openings aligned with the entrance opening being enlarged to form a gradually enlarging area extending along the length and width of said second insulation layer so that the opening extends to and substantially across the width of the opposite end thereof, a third insulating layer covering said second insulating layer and having first means at one end defining an opening aligned with the exit opening and second means at the opposite end defining a slit type opening extending substantially across the width of said opposite end, a permeable adsorber layer positioned above said third insulation layer, a transparent cover layer extending across said collector and sealed to said side walls, and mounting means positioned about the exterior of the entrance and exit openings for connecting said collector directly to the atmosphere in the building, said mounting means including air circulation means for circulating air from the building through the collector and back to the building. 2. A solar collector for heating a building comprised of an outer housing having rear and side walls, said rear wall including spaced apart air entrance and exit openings adjacent one end, first, second and third insulating layers located within said housing, said first and second layers each having entrance and exit openings aligned with those in said rear wall, said second layer further including means for defining a channel therein leading from the entrance opening toward the other end thereof, said channel means expanding along its length so that it extends substantially across the width of said other end, said third layer including an exit opening at one end thereof aligned with the exit opening in said rear wall and an elongated opening at the opposite aligned with the termination of the opening at said other end of said second layer, a porous collector positioned above said third layer, transparent cover means for closing said housing and mounting means positioned about said entrance and exit for connecting said collector to the atmosphere in the building and circulating at least a portion of that atmosphere therethrough. 3. A solar space heater comprised of an outer housing having rear and side members and a transparent front member, at least first, second and third layers of insulation mounted in contact with one another within said outer housing between said front and rear members so that said first, second and third layers are spaced from said front member thereby defining a chamber therebetween, said second layer being positioned between said first and third layers and having a predetermined portion cut away to define an internal duct extending therebetween extending from one end to the other of said second layer, means defining an inlet and outlet for said heater, said inlet means leading to said internal duct, said outlet leading to said chamber, said third layer defining one side of said chamber and having means defining an opening at one end in communication with said outlet means and another opening at the end opposite said one end in communication with said internal duct and a plurality of layers of blackened mesh material positioned within said chamber.
