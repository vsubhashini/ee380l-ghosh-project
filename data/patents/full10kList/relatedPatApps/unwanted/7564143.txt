Oceanic tidal energy sources hydroelectric generating system coupled to a primary tidal basin through a bi-directional tideway exciting a turbine as a diurnal cycle tide waxes and wanes. A secondary tidal basin includes a tideway and turbine with flow modulated by a regulator gate to proportionately blend reserve tidewater capacity of the secondary tidal basin as a delayed resource compensating a slacking of the primary tidal flow with a graduated secondary tidal basin influx or outflow providing an aggregate summation of tidal energy acting upon the turbines to continuously drive generators and deliver a constant flow of electric power throughout the diurnal tidal cycle. Shunting excess tidal energy around the turbines during periods of reduced electric power demand furthers a full capacity of tidal resources in subsequent phases of the diurnal tidal day when solar day related power demand may increase.
