The present invention offers a low cost, modular structure with a continuous, horizontal, rotatable spine supported on posts fixed to the ground, providing one axis of rotation for pointing solar collectors in the North-South direction and vertical roll axis bars mounted orthogonally to the spine providing an additional axis of rotation in the East-West direction. Push rods provide linear motion for control of any number of solar collector modules, with the linear motion being translated to rotary motion by pulleys and cables attached to wheels or arc segments mounted to the spine and roll axis bars. Thus, a whole array of solar collector modules can be driven by a single solar tracking device and two drive devices. Additionally, when arrayed in multiple rows of the number of solar collector modules controlled can be multiplied so that a "solar farm" covering a large area could be controlled by the single solar tracking device and a minimal number of drive devices.
