A solar energy collection system for receiving and collecting a concentrated supply of available energy from the sun includes a reflector having an internal structural frame covered by a thin deformable film at the front and a membrane cover enclosing the remainder of the structure. The front film has a reflective surface deformable into the desired configuration by the creation of a partial vacuum within the reflector. The reflector is driven by a two axis tracking mechanism directed by controls including a microprocessor programmed with data providing the position of the sun. The sun's rays are reflected from the reflective surface into an absorber through which working fluid circulates and which has a low radiation loss tube matrix design. The tubes are supported from a heat exchanger plate at one end of the absorber by means of rods carried by the plate which trap a beaded lip at the end of the tubes. Various safety and efficiency interrupts/overrides are incorporated into the controls to forestall or to terminate tracking and return the reflector to a stored position when, for example, there is insufficient solar insolation and/or excessive wind at the reflector location.
Claims Having thus described the nature of the invention, what is claimed herein is: 1. A solar energy collection system for receiving and collecting a concentrated supply of available energy from the sun, said system comprising a substantially dish-shaped reflector having a frontal reflective surface for receiving rays of solar energy and convergingly reflecting the rays toward a focal point, an absorber disposed substantially at said focal point for absorbing the rays, a fixed support tower, mounting means for journally mounting said reflector on said tower for rotation about a substantially vertical axis relatively to said tower, means carried by said tower for journally mounting said reflector for pivotable movement about a substantially horizontal axis relatively to said tower, azimuth drive means responsive to an azimuth control signal for rotating said reflector about said vertical axis, altitude drive means responsive to an elevational control signal for pivoting said reflector about said horizontal axis, position responsive means on each of the azimuth and elevational drive means for generating azimuth and elevational position signals corresponding to the disposition of said reflector, solar insolation monitoring means for providing an enabling signal when available insolation is above a predetermined threshold amount, controller means having stored memory data including the azimuth and elevational position of the sun at all times relatively to the geographical location of the reflector for receiving the azimuth and elevational position signals and the enabling signal and for comparing the azimuth and elevational disposition of the reflector with the stored position and for generating said azimuth and elevational control signals, and means for selectively transmitting said control signals to said azimuth and elevational drive means to point said reflector at the sun. 2. A solar energy collection system as recited in claim 1 wherein said means for selectively transmitting said control signals comprises wind monitoring means for generating a wind signal representative of the velocity of the wind at the reflector location, said controller means including means for comparing said wind signal with a preselected value and for generating azimuth and elevational stow signals when said wind signal is above said preselected value, and means for overriding said azimuth and elevational control signals and for transmitting said stow signals to said azimuth and elevational drive means to point said reflector to a stow position. 3. A solar energy collection system as recited in claim 1 wherein said frontal reflective surface is resiliently deformable and said reflector comprises a substantially hollow frame enclosed by means including said frontal reflective surface, means including a pump for evacuating air from the interior of said reflector creating a partial vacuum to deform said frontal surface inwardly, position switch means disposed within the interior of said frame for shutting said pump when contracted by said reflective surface, pressure monitoring means for determining the existence of a preselected excessively low pressure within said reflector, means for venting the interior of said reflector to the exterior thereof upon the existence of said excessively low pressure, said controller including means for generating azimuth and elevational stow signals when said pressure is excessively low, and means for overriding said azimuth and elevational control signals and for transmitting the stow signals to said azimuth and elevational drive means to point said reflector to a stow position. 4. A solar energy collection system as recited in claim 1, including means for measuring the temperature at spaced points about the absorber, said controller comprising means for comparing said temperature and for generating fine tracking azimuth and elevational control signals when said temperatures are not substantially equal, and means for transmitting said fine tracking azimuth and elevational control signals respectively to said azimuth and elevational drive means to point said reflector to a position at which said temperatures are substantially equalized.
