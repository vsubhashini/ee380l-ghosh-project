A solar heat roofing system including a plurality of waterproof heat absorbing panels covering substantially the entire roof of a building. The panels are formed by a pair of waterproof sheets connected to each other by elongated spacers thereby forming a plurality of fluid channels extending between the ends of the panels. A plurality of upstanding, spaced apart glazing mounts extend along the upper surfaces of the panels parallel to the spacers, and a plurality of elongated glazing supports are positioned between the glazing mounts. The glazing mounts and supports are positioned such that they follow a regular pattern when adjacent panels overlap each other. Transparent or translucent sheets are then placed in the glazing mounts with the upper surface of the glazing support contacting the underside of the sheet. The transparent or translucent sheets provide a "greenhouse effect" to increase the heat absorption of the panels, and they provide protection for the panels. The ends of the panels fit into elongated slots formed in inlet and outlet manifolds by linear, laterally projecting flanges. The manifolds, which are also secured to the roof, contain a fluid conduit communicating with the slots. Consequently, heat transfer fluid flowing into the inlet manifold conduit flows through the fluid channels in the panel where heat is absorbed, and the transfer fluid then flows from the outlet manifold conduit to a heat utilization device.
