The present invention is a self-contained, solar powered heating and cooling system for a building. The collector has an insulated heating chamber, and a light transmissive cover and a thermostatically controlled vent. The chamber contains absorptive columns standing on the floor. An internal liquid conduit exposes the liquid to the heat within the chamber. The collector is connected to a remote thermal reservoir such that a liquid circuit and a separate gas circuit both circulate heated fluid to the reservoir. Heat can be stored in any of a liquid reservoir, thermal mass reservoir and gas reservoir. Wind powered generators and photovoltaic cells provide power for the system or other applications. The thermal reservoir has heat exchangers which deliver stored heat to the building or operate a heat operated refrigeration machine (e.g., a liquid absorption chiller). Additional self sustaining power sources may optionally be incorporated into the present invention.
