In a barricade warning light, a first casing formed from two (2) mated halves provides a detachable enclosure, inaccessible (except by a special key) before detachment of a second casing holding batteries replaceable with the casings detached. A mounting rod assembly extends from the first casing for attachment to a barricade. An electronic module holds a photocell, an LED and circuitry energizing the LED when the photocell detects darkness. The first casing has a (a) first opening for coupling the key to a switch controlling the warning light operation, (b) second opening for key insertion to couple (decouple) the first casing to (from) the mounting rod assembly and (c) third opening for key insertion to couple (decouple) the casings. With the casings decoupled, (a) the electronic module may be assembled (disassembled) to (from) the first casing and (b) a base plate is attachable (separable) to (from) the bottom of the first casing. When energized, each LED directs light to the center optical area of a conically shaped lens. One surface of each lens defines a lens system including a Fresnel lens for producing a cone of light with a short axis and the other surface defines pillow lenses for converting such light to a slightly divergent pattern. Each lens has retroreflective material at its peripheries and its corners for reflecting light as from automobile headlights. The warning light may consist of a single unidirectional lens unit or a bi-directional unit formed from a pair of LED's and a pair of back-to-back conically shaped lenses.
