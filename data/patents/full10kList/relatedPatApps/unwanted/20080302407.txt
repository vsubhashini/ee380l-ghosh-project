The solar cell module retaining structure according to claim 3, wherein the frame has an upper portion at an opening side of the connection portion thereof that inclines, and the holding member has a portion inclines at a lower side of a connecting portion end. 6. The solar cell module retaining structure according to claim 4, wherein the frame has an upper portion at an opening side of the connection portion thereof that inclines, and the holding member has a portion inclines at a lower side of a connecting portion end. 7. The solar cell module retaining structure according to claim 1, further comprising a side surface frame that is fixed to a side different from a side where the frame is fixed around the solar cell panel body and has a notched groove through which the holding member can pass and a side surface cap that covers the notched groove of the side surface frame and is fixed to the frame, wherein by removing the side surface cap, while the holding member is supported at the supporting member, the solar cell module fixed by the holding member can be slid in an extending direction of the frame to remove the solar cell module from the holding member 8. A frame for a solar cell module retaining structure having a solar cell in a solar cell module and being fixed to at least a pair of facing sides around a flat polygon solar cell panel body, comprising an insertion support portion which has an opening at a first side surface side and into which a peripheral portion of the solar cell panel body is inserted to be supported, a connection portion which is arranged at a lower side of the insertion support portion and has an opening at a second side surface side at an opposite side of the first side surface, an engagement protrusion which is arranged at a lower side of the connection portion and has an opening at the second side surface side to project upward, said frame is extended in a long shape in a cross section. 9. A holding member for a solar cell module retaining structure to be fixed to at least a pair of facing sides around a flat polygon solar cell panel body with a solar cell in a solar cell module, to be fixed to a predetermined supporting member of the solar cell module via a frame extended in a long shape in a cross section, comprising an insertion support portion which has an opening at a first side surface side and into which a peripheral portion of the solar cell panel body is inserted to be supported, a connection portion which is arranged at a lower side of the insertion support portion and has an opening at a second side surface side at an opposite side of the first side surface, and an engagement protrusion which is arranged at a lower side of the connection portion and has an opening at the second side surface side to project upward, further comprising a pair of connecting portions insertable in the connection portion and extending in a direction to depart from each other; a down section extending downward from the pair of the connecting portions; a seat section arranged at a lower end of the down section and capable of mounting a bottom of the frame thereon, an engagement piece having an engagement protrusion portion positioned between the seat section and the connecting portion and extending from the down section in the same direction of the connecting portion to project an end downward so as to engage the engagement protrusion section; and a holding portion having a lower surface on the same surface of the lower surface of the seat section and extending in an opposite direction of the engagement piece extension so as to be fixed to the supporting member, and is designed to have a same cross-section shape and shorter than the frame. 10.
