The device for detection of the temperature in the interior of a vehicle, particularly for an air-conditioning system of a vehicle, is provided with an interior temperature sensor (28) arranged in a housing (18) arranged in or at a wall (12) adjacent to the interior (14) of the vehicle and being at least partially adjacent to the interior (14) of the vehicle, and a radiation sensor (30) detecting solar radiation leading to the heating of the housing (18) of the interior temperature sensor (28). Further, the device is provided with a compensation temperature sensor (36) arranged behind the wall (12) and such that it is thermally decoupled from the interior temperature sensor (28) and detecting the heat of air and/or assemblies behind the wall (12), which leads to a falsification of the measured value of the interior temperature sensor (28). The two temperature sensors (28,36) and the radiation sensor (30) are combined in a common assembly.
Claims 1. Device for detection of the temperature in the interior of a vehicle, particularly for an air-conditioning system of a vehicle, comprising an interior temperature sensor (28) arranged in a housing (18) arranged in or at a wall (12) adjacent to the interior (14) of the vehicle and being at least partially adjacent to the interior (14) of the vehicle, a radiation sensor (30) detecting solar radiation leading to the heating of the housing (18) of the interior temperature sensor (28), and a compensation temperature sensor (36) arranged behind the wall (12) and such that it is thermally decoupled from the interior temperature sensor (28) and detecting the heat of air and/or assemblies behind the wall (12) which leads to a falsification of the measured value of the interior temperature sensor (28), the two temperature sensors (28,36) and the radiation sensor (30) being combined in a common assembly. 2. Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the two temperature sensors (28,36) and the radiation sensor (30) are held by a common mounting plate (32). 3. Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the compensation temperature sensor (36) is thermally connected with at least one heat conducting surface (38,40,42,44) arranged behind the wall (12). 4. Device according to claim 2 and 3, characterized In that heat-conducting surfaces (38,40,42,44) are arranged on at least one surface (46,48) of the mounting plate (32) at both sides of the compensation temperature sensor (36).
