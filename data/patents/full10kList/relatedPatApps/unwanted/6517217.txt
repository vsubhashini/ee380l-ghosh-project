An ornamental solar lamp assembly is constructed to include a hollow base frame holding a solar collector and lamp circuit unit, and a lampshade covered on the base frame, the lampshade admitting light and, having a threaded neck threaded into female threads in an annular groove on the top side wall of the base frame, the solar collector and lamp circuit unit having a solar collector panel mounted on the top side wall of the base frame, a battery mounted inside the base frame, lead-out wires extended from the battery and suspended above the base frame within the lampshade, a plurality of LEDs installed in the lead-out wires, and a control circuit adapted to turn on the LEDs when dark.
Claims I claim: 1. An ornamental solar lamp assembly comprising: a hollow base frame covered with a bottom cover, said base frame comprising an annular groove formed on a top side wall thereof and female threads formed in said annular groove; a solar collector and lamp circuit unit installed in said base frame, said solar collector and lamp circuit unit comprising a battery mounted on said bottom cover and disposed inside said base frame, a solar-collector panel fixedly mounted on the top side wall of said base frame and adapted to convert the radiant energy of sunlight into electric power and to charge said battery with obtained electric power, positive and negative lead-out wires respectively extended from said battery and suspended above the top side wall of said base frame, light emitting means connected to said lead-out wires, and a control circuit adapted to control the transmission of battery power supply from said battery to said light emitting means through said lead-out wires; a lampshade fastened to the top side wall of said base frame and covered over said light emitting means, said lampshade admitting light and, comprising a threaded neck threaded into said female threads in said annular groove of said base frame; said bottom cover comprising a bottom screw hole for mounting; and said light emitting means being comprised of a plurality of light emitting diodes, and said lead-out wires being curved in different directions to hold said light emitting diodes in different angles. 2. The ornamental solar lamp assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein said light emitting means is comprised of a cold-cathode tube.
