Storage means according to claim 39, wherein a width and/or height of at least one holding compartment (11) is larger than a depth of this holding compartment (11). 45. Storage means according to claim 39, wherein at least two holding compartments (11), whose opening sections (13) are arranged on opposite outer sides of the storage means are adjacent to each other at their rear sides, or wherein three outer sides of the storage means have opening sections (13) and a holding compartment (11), whose opening section (13) is located on the middle outer side, extends between holding compartments (11), whose opening sections (13) are positioned on the extreme outer sides. 46. Storage means according to claim 39, wherein horizontal and/or vertical support elements (32, 33) are arranged between the holding compartments (11). 47. Storage means according to claim 39, wherein a horizontal distance between vertical support elements (32) corresponds to a width or/and a depth of at least one holding compartment (11), respectively. 48. Storage means according to claim 39, wherein the storage means can be assembled from modules and each module comprises at least one holding compartment (11). 49. Storage means according claim 39, wherein partition walls (14) are provided between the holding compartments (11) that can be fixed by means of mounting elements (80) to a floor area and/or to a side wall (15) and/or to an upper side (16) of the storage means. 50. Storage means according to claim 49, wherein the mounting elements (80) have a U-shaped cross section. 51. Storage means according to claim 49, wherein the partition walls (14) are fixed with a distance to the floor area determined by the mounting elements (80). 52. Storage means according to claim 39, wherein one opening section (13) can be closed by one or more closing elements (12) and/or wherein a plurality of opening sections (13) can be closed by one closing element (12). 53. Storage means according to claim 52, wherein at least one holding compartment (11) has on an outer side several closing elements (12) and the closing elements (12) generally extend across the entire area of the outer side. 54. Storage means according to claim 39, wherein at least one of the holding compartments (11) has opening sections (13) on two different outer sides of the storage means. 55. Storage means according to claim 39, wherein an upper side (16) of the storage means is realised as pitched roof, flat roof, pent roof or gabled roof, or wherein an upper side (16) of the storage means is arranged as a bed for plants or for greening. 56. Storage means according to claim 39, furthermore also comprising: at least one power supply connection; and/or at least one cable connection means, that is permanently connectable with a plug of an electrical appliance and that is furthermore suitable for releasing cable under tensile force and rewinding it when the tensile force is released. 57. Storage means according to claim 39, wherein the storage means has at least one solar panel, or wherein the storage means has at least one water connection, water tap and/or at least one water collection means. 58. Storage means according to claim 39, wherein the storage means has a central locking system for a plurality of holding compartments (11) and/or at least one local locking system for each holding compartment (11).
