A method of installing a plurality of collector pans between spaced apart roof rafters to cumulatively form a solar collector assembly defining a common fluid flow channel along the length of the collector assembly along which a heat transfer fluid can flow under the influence of gravity to be heated by exposure to solar radiation where each of the collector pans has a bottom wall and a pair of spaced apart side walls with a length less than the overall desired length of the common fluid flow channel and with the exterior size and shape of the downstream end of each of the collector pans conforming to the interior size and shape of the upstream end of each of the collector pans comprising the steps of: positioning a first of the collector pans between the roof rafters and connecting the collector pan to the roof rafters so that heat transfer fluid will flow along the upper surface of the bottom wall of the collector pan from its upstream end toward its downstream end under the force of gravity; positioning another of the collector pans between the roof rafters and connecting the collector pan to the roof rafters so that heat transfer fluid will flow along the upper surface of the bottom wall of the collector pan from its upstream end toward its downstream end under the force of gravity and so that the upstream end of one of the so positioned collector pans is overlapped by the downstream end of the other of the collector pans with the overlapped bottom walls of the collector pans in juxtaposition with each other so that the heat transfer fluid flows over the downstream end of the overlapping bottom wall onto the overlapped bottom wall to continue its flow down the fluid flow channel under the force of gravity; and, continuing to position other collector pans between the roof rafters and connecting each pan to the roof rafters so that heat transfer fluid will flow along the upper surface of the bottom wall of each collector pan from its upstream end toward its downstream end under the force of gravity and so that the downstream end of each collector pan overlaps the upstream end of the collector pan immediately downstream thereof with the overlapped bottom walls of the collector pans in juxtaposition with each other so that the heat transfer fluid flows over the downstream end of the overlapping bottom wall onto the overlapped bottom wall to continue its flow down the fluid flow channel under the force of gravity until a common fluid flow channel is formed of the desired length. 43. The method of claim 42 wherein the steps of positioning each of the collector pans after the first collector pan has been positioned includes forming an air gap between the overlapping bottom walls to prevent capillary attraction from forcing the heat transfer fluid between the overlapped bottom walls of the collector pans and out of the fluid flow channel. 44. A method of operating a solar collector made up of a plurality of overlapping collector pans to form a common fluid flow channel comprising the steps of: causing a heat transfer fluid to flow serially down the collector pans under the force of gravity so that the heat transfer fluid flows over the downstream ends of the collector pans onto the upstream ends of the next downstream collector pan; and, causing a pool of heat transfer fluid to form at the downstream end of the overlapping collector pans in contact with the downstream end of the overlapping collector pans to prevent the formation of droplets of heat transfer fluid at the downstream end of the overlapping collector pans which tend to flow down the surface of the heat transfer fluid flowing down the next downstream collector pan without being completely absorbed.
