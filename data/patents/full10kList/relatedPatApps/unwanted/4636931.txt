There is disclosed a photovoltaic power control system equipped with at least one inverter for inverting an output of a solar cell array to AC power, and having charge-and discharge control means for charging a surplus portion with respect to the power for expected use of the output of the solar cell array to a storage battery and discharging shortage portion with respect to the power for expected use of the output of the solar cell array from the storage battery by detecting the surplus or shortage produced between the output of the solar cell array and AC power for expected use inverted by the inverter, the improvement comprising weather fluctuation pattern selection means for selecting one weather pattern out of various kinds of weather patterns preset based on weather information at a time point when the weather is forecasted on the day when the power is generated by the solar cell array; and workable pattern selection means for selecting one actuation pattern of the inverter corresponding to the weather pattern selected by the weather fluctuation pattern selection means out of various actuation patterns of the inverter preset corresponding to the weather pattern.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A photovoltaic power control system equipped with at least one inverter for inverting an output of a solar cell array to AC power, and having charge- and discharge control means for charging a surplus portion with respect to the power for expected use of the output of said solar cell array to a storage battery and discharging shortage portion with respect to the power for expected use of the output of said solar cell array from said storage battery by detecting the surplus or shortage produced between the output of said solar cell array and AC power for expected use inverted by said inverter, the improvement comprising: weather fluctuation pattern selection means for selecting one weather pattern out of various kinds of weather patterns preset based on weather information at a time point when the weather is forecasted on the day when the power is generated by said solar cell array; and workable pattern selection means for selecting one actuation pattern of the inverter corresponding to the weather pattern selected by said weather fluctuation pattern selection means out of various actuation patterns of the inverter preset corresponding to said weather pattern. 2. A photovoltaic power control system according to claim 1, wherein said actuation patterns of the inverter correspond to the number of actuating inverters of a predetermined capacity. 3. A photovoltaic power control system according to claim 1, wherein said actuation patterns of the inverter corresponds to actuation time of inverters of a predetermined capacity.
