The circuit rapidly connects and disconnects solar cells to a battery to be charged. As a result of this operation, a "force charge" is applied to the battery even when low radiation is incident on the solar cells, resulting in increased efficiency of a solar power generation system including the solar cells. For example, using the circuit according to the present invention, solar cells only have to provide one and a half times the power of the battery instead of three times the power, as with conventional solar power generation systems.
