Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar tracking system comprising: a. solar collector means for receiving radiant energy from the sun said solar collector means comprising a face portion said solar collector means receiving maximum energy input when said face portion is directed directly toward the sun; b. base means for mounting said solar collector means and other tracking system components; c. first pivotal mounting means for mounting said solar collector means whereby said solar collector means may be pivotal about a first pivot axis between an easterly and a westerly orientation to follow the path of the sun; d. servo-motor means operably attached to said solar collector means for drivingly rotating said collector means about said first pivot axis; e. control means for actuating said servo-motor in a forward or reverse direction; f. sun sensing means for sensing the relative position of the sun with respect to said face portion of said solar collector means operably mounted on said face portion, said sun sensing means providing electric control signals to said control means in response to the movement of the sun whereby said face portion of said collector means is periodically redirected toward the sun; g. light intensity sensing means operably mounted on said face portion for providing control signals to said control means at a preselected level of sunlight intensity whereby said control means actuated said servo-motor to rotate said solar collector means for an easterly to a westerly orientation at a predetermined rate independent of the position of the sun when the intensity of the sunlight is below said preselected level, and wherein said control means actuates said servo-motor in response to signals from said sun sensing means when the intensity of sunlight is above said preselected level; h. sunset switching means for overriding said sun sensing means and said light intensity sensing means for providing a control signal to said control means when said solar collector means has rotated to a position corresponding to the sunset position of the sun whereby said control means actuates said servo-motor to return said solar collector to a position corresponding to the sunrise position of the sun; whereby said solar collector is positioned at a predetermined sunrise position at the beginning of each solar day, follows the sun from sunrise to sunset during bright snlight or cloud cover conditions and returns to the predetermined sunrise position at sunset; wherein said sun sensing means comprises a first phototransistor means for generating an electric signal and a shroud means for enclosing said first phototransistor means; wherein said shroud means comprises a regular parallel piped having a first face fixedly positioned on the face of said solar collector means and a second transparent face positioned in a westerly facing direction wherein direct sunlight strikes said first phototransistor means only by passing through said transparent westerly oriented face; wherein said light intensity sensing means comprises a second phototransistor means for generating an electric signal, the intensity of which is dependent on the intensity of sunlight; wherein said second phototransistor means comprises an enclosing means having a convex transparent face for receiving sunlight from a direction generally perpendicular to said face portion of said solar collector and from angles substantially divergent therefrom; wherein said solar collector means comprises a parabolic trough solar collector; wherein said parabolic trough solar collector is operably connected to a solar energy generating unit comprising: heat medium for energy transfer; a heat medium surge tank for holding said heat medium; circulation conduit means in communication with said surge tank for circulating said heat medium; circulation pump means operably communicating with said circulated conduit means for circulating said heat medium therethrough; preheating means operably positioned about said circulation conduit means for preheating the heat medium therein downstream said circulation pump means; said parabolic trough collector attached in fluid communication with said circulation conduit means downstream said preheating means for further heating said heat medium; two way temperature control valve means having a first and second outlet for selectively directing said heat medium through a recirculation conduit means or a turbine conduit means in response to heat medium temperature in communication with said parabolic trough collector; recirculation conduit means in fluid communication with said a first outlet of said two-way temperatures control valve means and said circulation pump means; turbine conduit means in fluid communication with said second outlet of said two-way temperature control valve means; pressure control valve means in fluid communication with said turbine conduit means for providing a constant downstream pressure therein; turbine means for generating electric current operably positioned in fluid communication with said turbine conduit downstream said pressure control valve; return line conduit means in fluid communication with said turbine means and said heat medium surge tank for returning said heat medium to said surge tank said return line means being operably connected to said preheater means for providing heat transfer between said return conduit means and said circulation conduit means.
