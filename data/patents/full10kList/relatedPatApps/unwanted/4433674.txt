A solar collector assembly is provided comprising an absorber means adapted to transfer heat to a fluid, a solar energy transmitting cover member, a housing adapted to receive said cover member and to contain said absorber means, said housing having a bottom wall and a plurality of foot sections adapted to receive an after-defined elastomeric body, and an elastomeric body fastened to said foot sections, said elastomeric body having an articulated slot adapted to slideably receive an insert adapted to engage fastener means associated with a mounting bracket to movably secure said housing to said bracket.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar collector assembly comprising an absorber means adapted to transfer heat to a fluid moving therealong; a solar energy transmitting cover member; a housing adapted to contain said absorber means, said housing having a collar section extending around the periphery thereof; sealing means located at the collar section of the housing; a clamping means extending along the collar section to substantially uniformly bias the transmitting member toward the collar section of the housing, said housing having a bottom wall, sidewalls and a plurality of spaced-apart foot sections adapted to receive a plurality of after-defined elastomeric bodies, said sidewalls being tapered and extended to form at least a portion to said foot sections; and elastomeric bodies fastened within said foot sections, said elastomeric bodies having an articulated slot adapted to slideably receive an insert adapted to engage a fastener means associated with a mounting bracket to movably secure said housing to said bracket, said articulated slot having a channel section in communication with at least one laterally extending undercut section, said insert having a base and a sleeve, said channel section being adapted to receive said sleeve and said undercut section being adapted to receive said base, said articulated slot having a recess in communication with said undercut section, said recess being adapted to receive a retainer means adapted to secure said elastomeric body to said foot section. 2. The solar collector assembly to claim 1 wherein said sleeve has a distal end located within said elastomeric body. 3. The solar collector assembly of claim 2 wherein said retainer means is a pin adapted to extend through one of said foot sections and the recess of said elastomeric body.
