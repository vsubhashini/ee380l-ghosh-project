An improved solar panel system is provided which is constructed for mounting of solar collector panel modules between conventionally spaced and sloped roof rafters. The solar panel modules include integral gutter portions and integral flashing portions. The solar panel system also includes a system of top and side flashings which complement the integral flashings of the solar panel modules so as to provide a solar panel system integrable with a conventional roof shingle system to provide leak-proof mounting of the solar panel system within the conventional shingle roof structure.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar panel system for the mounting of solar panel modules between conventionally spaced and sloped roof rafters, and for integration of said modules with a conventional roof shingle system for leakproof mounting of said modules, comprising: first and second solar panel modules, each of said modules having a collector housing with a substantially vertical ridge extending around the periphery thereof, and each module having integral side gutter portions and integral upper and lower flashing portions; a first complementary side flashing having an inverted sealing channel for engagement with an outer wall of one of said side gutters of said first solar panel module; a second complementary side flashing having an inverted sealing channel for engagement with an outer wall of one of said side gutters of said second solar panel module; a separate inverted sealing channel for engagement with an outer side wall of adjacent gutter portions of each of said solar panel modules; a first upper outer complementary flashing, for sealing engagement with said first complementary side flashing and said integral upper flashing of said first module; a second upper outer complementary flashing, for sealing engagement with said second complementary side flashing and said integral upper flashing of said second module; and a central upper complementary flashing for sealing engagement with said integral upper flashings of said first and second modules. 2. The solar panel system of claim 1 wherein: each of said panel modules includes a sloped ramp portion extending from the upper end of said collector housing and extending between said gutter portions so that water running across said solar panel system will be diverted into said gutter portions and away from said collector housing; and each of said central and first and second outer upper complementary flashings includes: flap means, partially coextensive with one of said sloped ramp portions; an integral inverted sealing channel, closed and rounded on its upper end and open at its lower end for sealing engagement with another of said inverted sealing channels; and a gutter junction portion, between said inverted sealing channel of said upper complementary flashing and said flap means, for diverting water across said upper complementary flashing into a gutter portion of one of said modules.
