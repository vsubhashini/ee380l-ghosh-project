Water reclamation from gas turbine combustion exhaust flow presents an opportunity to provide water for use in a solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant, particularly in arid environments. Cooled feedwater is fed through condensing pipes disposed in a water reclamation exchange that is adapted to facilitate condensing the gas combustion exhaust vapor passing through the exchange.

The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprising: causing a supplemental fossil fuel generated heat to be added to the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) such that temperature of the steam produced by the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) is maintained within an inlet operating tolerance of the steam generator, the supplemental fossil fuel generated heat being added to the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) if the CSP thermal energy contribution to the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) falls below a predetermined threshold. 6. A method of water reclamation in a supplemental direct solar super-heated steam solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant, the method comprising: causing a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant to receive waste heat thermal energy from waste heat produced by a gas combustion process driving a gas turbine; causing the HRSG to use the waste heat to produce steam to drive a steam generator; feeding steam from a boiler portion of the HRSG into a concentrated solar power (CSP) field; causing the CSP field to super heat the steam resulting in the formation of superheated steam; directing the super-heated steam from the CSP field to the steam generator to drive a steam turbine; recovering vapor from the steam generator; condensing the vapor using an air cooled condenser to form water; feeding the water into a water reclamation exchange adapted to condense exhaust vapor from a gas combustion exhaust system to form exhaust water; and collecting and cleaning the exhaust water for use.
