Hitherto, efficient combined solar heating and passive cooling has not been available in a convenient, modular, relatively simple to install, reasonably priced apparatus. A reservoir (12) has a cover (32) having upper (42) and lower (44) reflective surfaces. Liquid (26) fills the reservoir (12) to a desired level (28). The cover (46) is positionable in either closing relation over the open top (24) of the reservoir (12) with the upper surface (42) reflecting sunlight away from the reservoir (12) or in open relation with the lower surface (44) aligned generally to reflect sunlight towards liquid (26). A normally floating raft (68) substantially covers the top surface (30) of the liquid (26) to retard cool weather daytime evaporation and other heat losses from the liquid (26). The raft (68) may be removed at night during warm weather to provide efficient evaporative and radiative cooling.
