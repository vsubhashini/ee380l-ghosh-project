A flat-plate lighting device comprising a lamp body and a lamp post; the lamp body related to a flat-plate frame having on its top disposed with a sheet matrix-like arrangement of a solar moudle, and on its inner-bottom connected to a light emitting area and a accommodation area with the lighting emitting area comprised of one or a plurality of lighting unit of LED and the accommodation area being related to a thicker box; the box contains a solar cell and a circuit board, the circuit board converts the sunlight energy from the solar moudle into electric energy and stored in the solar cell; the power is supplied to the lighting unit once a electro-optical sensor detects insufficient ambient luminance; and a power monitor circuit is added to the circuit board.
Claims 1. A flat-plate lighting device including a lamp body and a lamp post connected to each other; the lamp body being related to a flat-plate frame, a sheet solar moudle arranged in a pattern of matrix being disposed on a top of the frame; a lighting emitting area and an accommodation are being disposed to inner-bottom of the frame; the light-emitting area including one or a plurality of lighting unit containing multiple light emitting diodes; the accommodation area related to a thicker box containing a solar cell and a circuit board; said the box connected to the lamp post; the circuit board converting sunlight energy delivered from the solar moudle into electric energy to be stored in the solar cell; and the circuit board being activated to supply power to the lighting unit in case of insufficient ambient luminance. 2. The flat-plate lighting device as claimed in claim 1, wherein a electro-optical sensor is connected to the circuit board. 3. The flat-plate lighting device as claimed in claim 1, wherein a power monitor circuit is added to the circuit board; the power monitor circuit being provided with a controller; the controller being disposed with a circuit output sensor connected in parallel with a power supply circuit disposed to the rear of the main control circuit on the circuit board; a signal connecter being disposed to the power monitor circuit and connected via an output line to a remote control station. 4. The flat-plate lighting device as claimed in claim 1, wherein a power input sensor is provided to the power monitor circuit added to the circuit board; and the power input sensor is connected in parallel to a drive circuit associate with the lighting unit provided on a main control circuit of the circuit board.
