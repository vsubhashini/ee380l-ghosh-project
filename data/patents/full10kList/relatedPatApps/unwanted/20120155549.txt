The invention concerns a wireless communication device making use of a robust wireless communication method (RWCM), and its application on a rear view monitoring system. More specifically, a robust wireless communication device (RWCD) consists of a Data Selection part (11), a Modulation-Demodulation (M-D) part (12) and a TDMA RF Transceiver part (13) that is made up of an ISM Transceiver part (14) and an UHF Transceiver part (15). The Data Selection part (11) sorts the input data into simple or multimedia data, and sends them to the M-D part (12). The simple data are separated into two types: data that do not use multi-media or UHF wave band, and data that do use the UHF band. The M-D method for the former does not include the OOK (On/Off Keying) process which does get used for the latter. In the ISM Transceiver part (14), the non-UHF band simple data and multi-media data are communicated via ISM band or free small-power frequency range. The UHF Transceiver part (15) transmits and receives the simple data that use the UHF band.
