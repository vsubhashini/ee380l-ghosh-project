A swing with automatic swinging feature is provided including a swing assembly having a seat unit and interconnects connected between the seat unit and an overhang support. Also included is an automatic swinging module mounted on the seat unit. The module includes a weight adapted to move in a reciprocating manner for effecting the swinging of the swing assembly.
Claims We claim: 1. A swing with automatic swinging feature comprising, in combination: a mounting assembly including a pair of inverted L-shaped brackets each having a short horizontal extent with a pair of bores formed therein for receiving ends of an inverted U-shaped bolt which is fixedly coupled to a horizontally oriented support bar, the pair of L-shaped brackets further having elongated vertical extents depending from the short horizontal extents with a pivot post coupled therebetween with ends extending therefrom; a swing assembly including a seat unit having a bottom face and a thickened rear face with a lower edge coupled to a rear edge of the bottom face and extending upwardly therefrom, a pair of planar L-shaped side lips coupled to side edges of the bottom face and rear face of the seat unit and extending upwardly and forwardly therefrom, respectively, a retainer having a T-shaped configuration with a bottom of a vertical portion thereof being centrally coupled to a front edge of the bottom face of the seat unit and extending upwardly therefrom with a pair of laterally extending horizontal portions which abut the side lips, and a pair of rigid, linear upstanding members each having a lower end coupled to a top edge of the rear face of the seat unit and extending upwardly therefrom in parallel relationship for coupling with ends of the pivot post of the mounting assembly; and an automatic swinging module including a housing mounted on a lower surface of the bottom face of the seat unit of the swing assembly, a pair of geared racks mounted along side edges of a bottom of the module, a platform with a motor mounted thereon with a rotor extending therefrom with pinions fixedly coupled thereto for engaging the geared racks and moving thereon between a front and rear of the swing assembly, a 10 lb. Weight fixed to the platform, and a limit switch mounted on a front and a rear of the housing of the module for effecting movement of the platform in an opposite direction upon the depression thereof when the motor is supplied with power via a rechargeable battery, wherein a solar cell is mounted on a back surface of the rear face of the seat unit of the swing assembly and connected to the battery for recharging the same upon being exposed with light. 2. A swing with automatic swinging feature comprising: a swing assembly having a seat unit; and and a swinging module mounted on the seat unit, the swinging module having a housing having an interior space; a pair of gear tracks positioned in the interior space of the housing in substantially parallel spaced relationship with respect to each other, said gear tracks being fixedly coupled relative to said housing, said gear tracks being further aligned parallel with a line of movement of said swing assembly; a motor coupled to a platform positioned between the gear tracks, the motor having rotors extending outwardly from opposite sides of the motor, each rotor having a pinion for engaging an associated one of said gear tracks such that turning of said rotors moves said platform relative to said gear tracks substantially along said line of movement of said swing assembly for urging said swing assembly into a swinging motion when said platform is moved back and forth along said gear tracks by said motor. 3. The swing with automatic swinging feature as set forth in claim 2 wherein the module is situated on a lower surface of a bottom face of the seat unit. 4. The swing as set forth in claim 2, further comprising: a weight coupled to said platform for facilitating urging of said swing assembly into the swinging motion when said platform is moved by said motor. 5. The swing as set forth in claim 2, further comprising: a pair of limiting switches, each limiting switch being coupled to the housing on opposite sides of the motor such that the platform travels along the gear tracks between the limiting switches, each respective limiting switch being operationally coupled to the motor for reversing a direction of movement of the platform along the gear tracks upon depression of the respective limiting switch. 6. An automatic swing comprising: a mounting assembly including a pair of brackets, each bracket having a first extent having a pair of bores formed therein for receiving ends of an inverted generally U-shaped bolt, said bolt being fixedly coupled to a support bar, the pair of brackets further having second extents depending from the first extents; a pivot post having opposite ends, said pivot post being coupled to said brackets such that said pivot post extends between the brackets and each opposite end extends outwardly from an associated one of said brackets; a swing assembly including a seat unit having a bottom face and a rear face, said rear face having a lower edge coupled to a rear edge of the bottom face, said rear face extending upwardly from said bottom face; a pair of side lips coupled to side edges of the bottom face and rear face of the seat unit, said side lips extending upwardly from the bottom face and forwardly from the rear face; a retainer having a first portion and a second portion, a bottom of said first portion being coupled to a front edge of the bottom face of the seat unit, said first portion extending upwardly from the front edge of the bottom face, an end of said first portion being coupled to a middle said second portion such that said second portion extends outwardly from said end of said first portion to abut the side lips; a pair of upstanding members, a lower end of each upstanding member being coupled to a top edge of the rear face of the seat unit and extending upwardly from the top edge in parallel relationship with respect to each other, said upstanding members being for coupling with said opposite ends of the pivot post of the mounting assembly; an automatic swinging module including a housing mounted on a lower surface of the bottom face of the seat unit of the swing assembly, said swinging module including a pair of geared racks mounted along side edges of a bottom of the module, said swinging module including a platform, a motor being mounted on the platform, a rotor extending from the motor, the rotor having pinions for engaging the geared racks for moving the pinions on the gear racks between a front and rear of the swing assembly; a weight fixed to the platform; a limit switch being mounted on a front and a rear of the housing of the module, each limit switch being for reversing a direction of movement of the platform along the gear tracks upon the depression of the respective limit switch; the motor being operationally coupled to a battery for providing power to the motor; and a solar cell mounted on a back of the rear face of the seat unit, the solar cell being operationally connected to the battery for recharging the battery.
