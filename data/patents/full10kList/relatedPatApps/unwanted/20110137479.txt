A solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant is controlled using thermal energy processing component thermal inertia characteristic data and atmospheric condition prediction information to adjust plant operations at a point in time that enables the plant to operate within a predetermined requirement when the plant experiences the predicted atmospheric condition.
Claims 1. A method of controlling a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant, the method comprising: storing in a database a plurality of operational rules governing operation of the CSP plant in which predefined atmospheric conditions are predicted to occur in proximity to the CSP plant; operating the CSP plant by a selected operational rule, from the plurality of operational rules, in accordance with the predicted atmospheric event; causing a learning system to monitor a performance aspect of the CSP plant during its operation in accordance with the selected operational rule during the predicted atmospheric event; and causing the learning system to modify the selected operational rule based on a learned behavior determined in response to the monitoring step. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the operational rule relates to a short term thermal storage facility. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the operational rule relates to a long term thermal storage facility.
