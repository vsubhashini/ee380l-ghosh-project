A microarray uses small, irregularly shaped, or nonplanar surfaces on a satellite to maximize power generation without introducing a significant weight penalty. The microarray includes a plurality of individual solar cells normally provided by dicing a conventional solar cell junction into the smaller solar cells. Microarray design involves using the available area for supporting the microarray, the voltage contribution from the individual solar cells, the voltage requirement of the microarray to determine the number of smaller solar cells that are necessary and their size.
