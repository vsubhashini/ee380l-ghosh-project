The present invention describes a solar panel system tracker that closely approximates the output levels of an actively tracked system but at significantly reduced levels of complexity and cost. The present invention utilizes a clock that generates a five degree step function which moves the solar panel system in five degree increments over the period of the solar day. This provides approximately thirty-five separate adjustments throughout the day, yielding an aggregate output performance of approximately 90 percent compared to a fully tracked system.
