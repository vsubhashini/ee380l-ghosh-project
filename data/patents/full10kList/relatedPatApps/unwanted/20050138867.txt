The tridimensional ecological roads have light transmitting and refractive devices. Ecological spaces for organisms and habitants can be provided above, on, or under the tridimensional ecological road type, land type ecological buildings. The ecological towns have tridimensional ecological walls, tridimensional ecological rivers (lakes), which may be entirely or partly surrounding the ecological towns. Ecological walls may be flood-preventing type or secure type. Walls can be provided with aboveground and underground plants environments, ecological spaces, warm house, watch towers, gardens, hills and water, wall bridges, closed doors with various forms and structures, which may be combined with other ecological structures for organisms, and which may be inside or outside the buildings, may be integrated with simple barriers, buildings structures with high, middle and low qualities. Tridimensional ecological river systems may be the water systems comprising rivers, lakes, water reservoirs, ecological cultivation buildings, water purifying devices, polluted water dealing devices, various river sections for cultivation of organisms (aquatics), which may be aboveground, underground, opened to the air, closed, or opened and closed, and which may be connected with external water systems. Tridimensional ecological walls, tridimensional ecological rivers, cooperating building structures and cooperating devices may be with different structures and different numbers, which may be combined with tridimensional ecological towns, single house, or combined houses, or may be separate for use. Tridimensional ecological towns may be provided with none, either, or both tridimensional ecological walls and ecological towns, or only use common barriers, rivers, roads and buildings to divide the ecological towns to different areas. A type of air water exsiccating, purifying and filtering devices from air according to cooling/heating principles, comprise air inlets, air heating structures, air cooling and water filtering structures, water outlets, air outlets and other cooperating devices, in which air can be heated by heating winds, electrics, heating gases, heating water, methane, and cooled by electrics, cooling winds, cryogens, ice, cold grounds. They can be applied to ecological buildings, warm houses as cooperating devices, with a series of products that have different forms, structures, occupied volumes. They can be provided with sanitation devices using electric or ultraviolet lights, which may be boxes, pipes, passages and other forms. Cooling/heating pipes, suspended plates, suspended pipe networks can be used for heating and cooling, which can be integrated with exsiccating devices and other functional devices. They can be applied to humid areas as civil products, such as ecological buildings, warm house cooperating devices for plants and organisms. 10. A tridimensional ecological land-type ecological architecture, which comprises building structures with one or more storeys that are under the grounds, under the grounds of ecological plant covers and organisms that are aboveground. The ecological plant covers lands may be flat, may be in the form of tridimensional garden buildings, hills and water, lakes, building patios, agriculture buildings, or may be the combinations of multiple ecological plant covers and the building gardens. The tridimensional land type ecological buildings may also be added one or more layer of frame type ecological building structures above the ecological plant covers lands. A type of top roof frame type transparent ecological building structures (and hood type ecological covers), comprise aboveground or underground tridimensional ecological buildings and top roof frame type structures. The top roof frame type transparent structures comprise frames and transparent glasses. The frames may be metallic frames, concrete frames, or the combined frames, with their forms and structures being bi-dimensional or tridimensional, which may be opened to the air, or opened and closed. The frames can be provided with sunlight refractive and transmitting devices, solar power generation devices. Sand-proof cover devices that can prevent sands may also be provided on the frames, which may be opened and closed automatically or manually, which can be applied not only to top roof frame type transparent structures, but also to passage type ecological awning buildings, tridimensional agriculture awnings, transparent warm houses and other ecological buildings and devices. Various types of tridimensional ecological buildings comprise multifunctional tridimensional combined ecological architectures, hood type ecological buildings, aboveground and underground ecological buildings, tridimensional land type ecological buildings, tree type tridimensional ecological buildings for organisms, turret type ecological buildings, aboveground and underground combined passage type ecological buildings, multifunctional ecological buildings, Taiji graphics (Yixue) type ecological buildings for organisms and other ecological buildings with cooperating devices and systems. The functions of combined village-house type functional ecological buildings may be entirely, partly or separately combined with the functions of several tridimensional ecological buildings. The functions of the unit spaces in the several tridimensional ecological buildings may be separately, partly or entirely combined.
