A mounting plate is arranged to overlie an ice fishing opening within an ice plate wherein the mounting plate includes a downwardly extending support cylinder with the cylinder rotatably mounting a spool at its lower end with the spool coaxially aligned with the support cylinder. The cylinder includes an L-shaped guide hook to guide fishing line from the spool and mounts an axially displaced rotatable leg member in a parallel relationship, wherein the leg member includes a projection that cooperates with a further L-shaped member affixed to the spool whereupon rotation of the spool effects rotation of the leg member and the leg member includes a release leg at an upper terminal end thereof whereupon rotation of the release leg effects release of an indicator flag. The apparatus further includes a transparent bubble member to contain heat within the organization to maintain the ice plate opening in a free orientation relative to the apparatus.
Claims What is claimed as being new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent of the United States is as follows: 1. An ice fishing apparatus comprising, a mounting plate, the mounting plate including a support cylinder integrally and orthogonally mounted to a bottom surface of the mounting plate, and the support cylinder defined by a support cylinder axis, and the support cylinder including a spool rotatable about a spool axis wherein the spool axis is coaxially aligned with the support cylinder axis, and a guide leg mounted to the support cylinder with the guide leg including a guide leg eye overlying the spool to accommodate fishing line from the spool directed through the eye, and an actuator leg mounted to the spool, and an elongate leg member rotatably mounted relative to the spool wherein the leg member includes a leg member projection, the leg member projection positioned adjacent the spool to accommodate impact by the actuator leg to effect rotation of the leg member projection and the leg member, and the leg member including a release leg fixedly mounted to an upper terminal end of the leg member position above an upper surface of the mounting plate, and the release leg rotatable from a first position to a second position, and an indicator leg wherein the indicator leg includes biasing means fixedly mounted to a lower terminal end of the indicator leg to bias the indicator leg from the first position wherein the indicator leg is positioned underlying the release leg to a second position wherein the indicator leg is in a vertical position when the release leg is rotated relative to the indicator leg, and wherein the guide leg is an "L" shaped configuration and includes a horizontal guide leg portion and a vertical guide leg portion the horizontal guide leg portion radially integrally mounted to the support cylinder orthogonally relative to the support cylinder axis with the vertical guide leg portion extending downwardly relative to the support cylinder to overlie the spool with the guide leg eye mounted to a lower terminal end of the vertical guide leg portion, and wherein the actuator leg is of a generally "L" shaped configuration and includes a horizontal actuator leg portion and a vertical actuator leg portion, and the spool includes a spool flange rotatably mounted relative to the support cylinder, and the horizontal actuator leg portion integrally mounted to the spool, and the vertical actuator leg portion extending upwardly relative to the support cylinder, and the support cylinder includes a support cylinder disc integrally and coaxially mounted to a lower terminal end of the support cylinder between the support cylinder and the spool, and the elongate leg member rotatably mounted to the support cylinder disc, and the projection extending above the support cylinder disc a first spacing, and the vertical actuator leg portion extending above the support cylinder disc a second spacing equal to or greater than the first spacing. 2. Apparatus as set forth in claim 1 wherein the vertical actuator leg portion is spaced from the support cylinder axis a predetermined spacing, and the leg member projection is spaced from the support cylinder axis a projection spacing greater than or equal to the predetermined spacing when the projection is in the first position extending radially outwardly relative to the support cylinder axis. 3. Apparatus as set forth in claim 2 wherein the release leg includes a release leg recess wherein the release leg recess is oriented to receive the indicator leg when the indicator leg is in the first position. 4. Apparatus as set forth in claim 3 including a solar transparent dome, and the mounting plate formed of a transparent material wherein the transparent dome and the mounting plate are arranged to receive and capture radiant heat to maintain an opening within an ice layer underlying the mounting plate. 5. Apparatus as set forth in claim 4 wherein the transparent dome includes a leg member opening to rotatably receive the leg member therethrough with the upper terminal end of the leg member and release leg positioned above the solar transparent dome.
