A towed airborne array system has a balloon that supports appropriate instrumentation packages overhead and is tethered to a towing ship to improve line-of-sight sensing and communication capabilities to up to about 100 nautical miles. These improved capabilities can benefit relatively small surface combatant ships (CG, DD, FFG) and might provide an alternative location for having countermeasures placed on a warship.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for improving line-of-sight communications and data gathering for a ship comprising: a balloon filled with a lighter than air gas to buoy it to altitudes extending from 5,000 to 15,000 feet in the air; communication equipment and sensor equipment mounted on said balloon to provide communication and data gathering capabilities; a tether line to connect said balloon to said ship, said tether line having strength members, optical data fibers, wire electrical power conductors, and wire electrical data conductors extending from said balloon to said ship, said strength members providing sufficient strength to tow said balloon by said ship while underway, said electrical power conductors coupling electrical power to said communication equipment and said sensor equipment, and said optical data fibers and wire electrical data conductors bi-directionally transmitting optical and electrical control and data signals between said communication equipment and said sensor equipment and appropriate modules on said ship; a first power source mounted on said ship to supply electrical power on said power conductors to said communication equipment and said sensor equipment to provide communication and data gathering capabilities during connection of said tether line between said ship and said balloon; and a second power source mounted on said balloon to supply, electrical power to said communication equipment and said sensor equipment to provide communication and data gathering capabilities during disconnection of said tether line between said ship and said balloon, said second power source being solar cells mounted on said balloon. 2. The system of claim 1 further comprising: a hangar on said ship to stow said balloon and communication equipment, said sensor equipment, and said solar cells of said second power source; a quick disconnect included in said tether line to separate and free said ship from said balloon and said communication equipment, sensor equipment and said solar cells of said second power source; and a buoy and sea anchor connected to said tether line to hold said balloon and communication equipment, sensor equipment, and said solar cells of said second power source at said altitudes during disconnection of said balloon, communication equipment, sensor equipment, and said solar cells of said second power source from said ship, said solar cells of said second power source permitting autonomous operation separate from said first power source. 3. A method for improving line-of-sight communications and data gathering for a ship comprising the steps of: buoying a balloon filled with a lighter than air gas to altitudes extending from 5,000 to 15,000 feet in the air; mounting communication equipment and sensor equipment on said balloon to provide line-of-sight communication and data gathering capabilities; tethering said balloon and said communication equipment and said sensor equipment to said ship with a tether line having strength members, optical data fibers, wire electrical power conductors, and wire electrical data conductors extending from said balloon to said ship; providing a first source of electrical power on said ship to supply electrical power on said electrical power conductors to said communication equipment and said sensor equipment to assure communication and data gathering capabilities during connection of said tether line between said ship and said balloon; providing a second power source on said balloon to supply electrical power to said communication equipment and said sensor equipment to assure communication and data gathering capabilities during disconnection of said tether line between said ship and said balloon; said second power source being solar cells mounted on said balloon; towing said balloon with said ship during connection of said tether line between said ship and said balloon while underway, providing sufficient strength with said strength members to effect said steps of tethering and towing by said ship while underway; coupling electrical power from said first power source on said ship to said communication equipment and said sensor equipment via said electrical power conductors; and bi-directionally transmitting optical and electrical control and data signals between said communication equipment and said sensor equipment and modules on said ship via said optical data fibers and wire electrical data conductors. 4. The method of claim 3 further comprising the steps of: stowing said balloon and said communication equipment, said sensor equipment, and said solar cells of said second power source in a hangar on said ship; connecting a buoy and sea anchor to said tether line to hold said balloon and said communication equipment, said sensor equipment, and said solar cells of said second power source at said altitudes; separating and freeing said ship from said balloon and said communication equipment, said sensor equipment, and said solar cells of said second power source via a quick disconnect included in said tether line; and autonomously operating said communication equipment, and said sensor equipment with electrical power from said solar cells of said second power source.
