A low cost diagnostic system for testing the airborne static discharge systems and the grounding systems for aircraft. The present invention is a passive electrostatic detection scheme which in one embodiment is an array of inexpensive, miniaturized sensors for measuring the detected E-field disturbances from aircraft. The measurements are taken on the runway upon arrival and indicate whether the aircraft had an appreciable accumulated charge indicating a failure of the electrostatic discharge system. The system further verifies that the ground discharge devices are properly working and any charge is dissipated upon landing. In one embodiment the measurement information is transmitted to a central location where the aircraft and the measurement data are matched and maintenance is scheduled for aircraft having high levels of electrostatic charge.
