A bioassaying device for carrying out an experiment with a subject placed under a transparent portion of a base plate. The subject is irradiated with light rays emitted from light-emitting ends of three fiber optic cables. One of the three fiber optic cables radiates light rays containing plenty of the red color-spectrum component, another cable radiates the blue component and the remaining cable radiates the green component. Each of the fiber optic cables is provided with a mechanism for adjusting its inclination angle simultaneously with vertical movement of a moving plate upon which the fiber optic cables are mounted.
Claims I claim: 1. A bioassay device for exposing a living organism to visible light rays to test reaction of the living organism to said light rays, comprising a base plate having a transparent portion; a plurality of column members mounted vertically on said base plate; adjustable plate means mounted on said column members above said base plate; first adjustment means for moving said adjustable plate means vertically on said column members to adjust distance of said adjustable plate means with respect to said base plate; first fiber optic cable means mounted on said adjustable plate means at an inclined angle with respect to said adjustable plate means and including a first light-emitting end for emitting red color component rays of visible light rays and transmitting said red color component rays through said transparent portion of said base plate and onto a living organism arranged under said transparent portion; second fiber optic cable means mounted on said adjustable plate means at an inclined angle with respect to said adjustable plate means and including a second light-emitting end for emitting blue color component rays of visible light rays and transmitting said blue color component rays through said transparent portion and onto said living organism; third fiber optic cable means mounted on said adjustable plate means at an inclined angle with respect to said adjustable plate means and including a third light-emitting end for emitting green color component rays of visible light rays and transmitting said green color component rays through said transparent portion and onto said living organism; said first, second and third light-emitting ends of said fiber optic cable means not emitting infrared rays or ultraviolet rays; second adjustment means for adjusting the inclined angle of each of said fiber optic cable means with respect to said adjustable plate means simultaneously with adjustment of said distance of said adjustable plate means with respect to said base plate, thereby ensuring the transmitting of color component rays through the transparent portion of said base plate when the distance of said adjustable plate means with respect to said base plate is adjusted; color temperature sensor means arranged on said base plate for monitoring color temperature of rays emitted from said first, second and third light-emitting ends of said fiber optic cable means and transmitted onto said living organism; third adjustment means responsive to said color temperature sensor means for controlling the distance of each light-emitting end from the transparent portion of said base plate to thereby control color temperature of rays transmitted onto said living organism; and illumination intensity sensor means arranged on said base plate for monitoring illumination intensity of rays emitted from said first, second and third light-emitting ends of said fiber optic cable means and transmitted onto said living organism, said first adjustment means being responsive to said illumination intensity sensor means for moving said adjustable plate means to adjust distance thereof with respect to said base plate to thereby control illumination intensity of rays transmitted onto said living organism. 2. A bioassay device as in claim 1, further comprising solar ray collecting means for collecting solar rays; and solar ray transmitting means for transmitting collected solar rays from said solar ray collecting means to each of said fiber optic cable means. 3. A bioassay device as in claim 1, further comprising laboratory dish means arranged beneath said base plate and adapted to receive therein said living organism for bioassay. 4. A bioassay device as in claim 1, further comprising fourth fiber optic cable means mounted on said adjustable plate means for emitting white visible light rays and transmitting said white visible light rays through said transparent portion of said base plate and onto said living organism. 5. A bioassay device as in claim 1, further comprising fourth adjustment means for adjusting distance of said base plate from the living organism arranged under said transparent portion of said base plate.
