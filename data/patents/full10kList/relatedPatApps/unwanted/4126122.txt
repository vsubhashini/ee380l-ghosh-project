A solar powered heater system which may be employed to preheat water in or prior to delivery to a conventional hot water heater. The solar powered heater system includes a heat exchanger which is formed from a tube having a contoured surface. This tubular heat exchanger is inserted in a tank through which the liquid to be heated passes. The heat exchanger is part of a closed loop, through which a heat transfer fluid is circulated, which includes an array of solar collectors. The heat transfer fluid may either be bypassed around the heat exchanger or caused to stop circulating when insufficiently heated by the solar energy.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A preheater for raising the enthalpy of a liquid comprising: solar energy collector means, said collector means defining a flow path for a heat transfer liquid, thermal energy being transferred to said heat transfer liquid during circulation thereof through said collector means; tank means, said tank means being adapted to have discharged thereinto adjacent a first end a second liquid which is to be heated, said tank means being provided with an outlet for said second liquid adjacent a second end thereof disposed oppositely of said tank means first end, said tank means further having an entrance aperture in the second end thereof; rim means, said rim means being adapted to be affixed to the wall of said tank means about the periphery of said entrance aperture; a disc, said disc having a shape commensurate with and a cross sectional area in excess of the tank means entrance aperture; a metal tube supported at a first end from said disc, said metal tube having contoured inner and outer wall surfaces which define a spiral configuration to promote a swirling flow along said wall surfaces to maximize the transfer of heat from a fluid within said tube to a fluid in contact with the exterior of said tube; an end cap affixed to and closing the second end of said tube; means removably securing said disc to said rim means whereby said tube extends into said tank means; a feed conduit, said feed conduit extending into said tube through said disc and terminating adjacent to the first end of said tube whereby fluid may be discharged into said tube at the first end thereof; a fluid withdrawal conduit, said withdrawal conduit extending into said tube through said disc and terminating adjacent said end cap whereby fluid may be withdrawn from said tube at the second end thereof; means connecting the interior of said tube in a closed heat transfer liquid circulation loop with said solar energy collector means, said connecting means being coupled to said feed and withdrawal conduits whereby heat transfer fluid will flow within said tube in counterflowing relationship with said second liquid exterior of said tube; pump means for circulating the heat transfer liquid through said closed loop; means for sensing the temperature of the heat transfer fluid and of the second liquid within said tank means; and means responsive to the sensed temperatures for energizing said pump means to circulate the heat transfer liquid through said tube when the temperature of the heat transfer liquid exceeds that of the second liquid in said tank means by predetermined amount. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising: an auxiliary heater positioned within said tank means; means responsive to the sensed temperature of the tank means second liquid for energizing said auxiliary heater when the temperature of the second liquid within said tank means falls below a predetermined level. 3. A preheater for raising the enthalpy of a liquid comprising: solar energy collector means, said collector means defining a flow path for a heat transfer liquid, thermal energy being transferred to said heat transfer liquid during circulation thereof through said collector means; tank means, said tank means being adapted to have discharged thereinto adjacent a first end a second liquid which is to be heated, said tank means being provided with an outlet for said second liquid adjacent a second end thereof disposed oppositely of said tank means first end; a metal tube, said tube having contoured inner and outer wall surfaces; a lower end cap affixed to and closing a first end of said tube; flange means for removably mounting said tube to the wall of said tank means at the second end of said tank means, said tube being substantially entirely disposed within said tank means, said flange means and lower end cap cooperating to prevent leakage of fluid between the interior of said tank means and the interior of said tube; a feed conduit, said feed conduit extending into said tube through said flange means and terminating adjacent the second end thereof; a fluid withdrawal conduit, said withdrawal conduit extending into said tube through said flange means and terminating adjacent the first end thereof; means for sensing the temperature of the heat transfer liquid and of the second liquid within said tank means; means connecting the interior of said closed metal tube in a closed heat transfer liquid circulation loop with said solar energy collector means, said connecting means being coupled to said feed and withdrawal conduits and including: bypass conduit means, said bypass conduit means including a first valve, said bypass conduit means permitting heat transfer liquid to be circulated through said solar energy collector without passing through said tube; second valve means, said second valve means being connected in said closed circulation loop at the tube side of said bypass conduit means whereby the flow of heat transfer liquid through said tube may be selectively interrupted; and means for causing said bypass conduit means first valve to open and said second valve means to close when the temperature of said heat transfer liquid is below a predetermined level and for causing said bypass conduit means first valve to close and said second valve to open when the temperature of said heat transfer liquid exceeds the temperature of the second liquid in said tank means by a predetermined amount; pump means for circulating the heat transfer liquid through said closed loop; and means responsive to the sensed temperatures for energizing said pump means to circulate the heat transfer liquid through said tube when the temperature of the heat transfer liquid exceeds that of the second liquid in said tank means by a predetermined amount. 4. The apparatus of claim 3 wherein said tube extends into said tank means through the top thereof and wherein the liquid to be heated is delivered to said tank means adjacent the bottom thereof and removed from said tank means adjacent the top thereof whereby the heat transfer liquid and the liquid within said tank means flow in generally opposite directions. 5. The apparatus of claim 4 wherein the contoured wall of said metal tube has a spiral configuration to promote a swirling flow along said wall to maximize the transfer of heat from said heat transfer liquid to the fluid in said tank means, the heat transfer liquid flowing downwardly within said tube. 6. The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said flange means includes: rim means, said rim means being adapted to be affixed to the external wall of said tank means about the periphery of an entrance aperture provided in said tank means for insertion of said heat exchanger; a disc, said disc having a shape commensurate with and a cross-sectional area in excess of the tank means entrance aperture, said feed and withdrawal conduits passing through said disc; and means removably securing said disc to said rim means. 7.
