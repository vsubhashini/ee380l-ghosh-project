In an embodiment, a system may be used to heat a hydrocarbon containing formation. The system may include a conduit placed within an opening in the formation. A conductor may be placed within the conduit. The conductor may provide heat to a portion of the formation. In some embodiments, an electrically conductive material may be coupled to a portion of the conductor in the overburden. The electrically conductive material may lower the electrical resistance of the portion of the conductor in the overburden. Lowering the electrical resistance of the portion of the conductor in the overburden may reduce the heat output of the portion in the overburden. The system may allow heat to transfer from the conductor to a section of the formation.
