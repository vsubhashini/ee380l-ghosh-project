The invention relates to a receptacle (1) particularly suitable for wiring one or more solar cells (81). The receptacle (1) comprises a housing (10) and a connecting shaft (60) that can be separately closed by a cover (63). The receptacle (1) is raised from the back side of the solar panel (80).
Claims 1. A connecting box (1) having a housing (10), for connection of at least one electronic component (51), which is arranged on a printed circuit board (50) in the interior of the housing (10) to electrical connections of a solar panel (80), the connecting box comprising: a connecting slot (60) defined by a circumferential frame (62) having an essentially O-shaped cross section which opens at a lower end into a circumferential mounting surface (69); a projecting mounting cap (30) positioned with respect to the housing (10) for attachment of the connecting box (1) to a surface of the solar panel (80); and a rear wall of the housing (10), when in a fitted state, positioned at a distance (A) from the solar panel (80) resulting in convectional cooling of the housing (10). 2. The connecting box (1) of claim 1, wherein the connecting slot (60) is fitted peripherally to the housing (10). 3. The connecting box (1) of claim 1, wherein the mounting cap (30) is formed from a plurality of parts. 4. The connecting box (1) of claim 1, wherein the mounting cap (30) surrounds the connecting slot. 5. The connecting box (1) of claim 1, wherein the mounting cap (30) includes at least one adhesive surface (32, 33) for holding an adhesive and/or a double-sided adhesive tape (34). 6. The connecting box (1) of claim 1, further comprising: air guide plates (23) which are arranged on the housing rear face. 7. The connecting box (1) of claim 6, wherein the air guide plates (23) are designed such that, in the fitted state, they are used to support the housing (10) with respect to a solar panel (80). 8. The connecting box (1) of claim 1, wherein, at least in places, the housing (10) rests closely on the printed circuit board (50) such that heat which is created is transported outwards through the housing (10). 9. The connecting box (1) of claim 8, wherein the printed circuit board (50) is a stamped grid. 10. The connecting box (1) of claim 1, wherein the housing (10) further comprises: a housing lower part (20) and a housing upper part (40) which closely surround the printed circuit board (50) and the at least one electronic component (51). 11. The connecting box (1) of claim 1, wherein the housing (10) is formed integrally by insert molding of the printed circuit board (50) and the at least one electronic component (51). 12. The connecting box (1) of claim 1, wherein the connecting slot (60) is suitable for holding an encapsulation medium.
