An automatic dispensing apparatus for dispensing hand-sanitizer lotion, which is powered using a rechargeable battery pack rechargeable via solar cells, which battery pack is pivotally mounted in the upper interior section of the main frame of the dispenser, above the liquid-storage bag, whereby as the liquid storage bag is depleted after continual use, the weight of the battery pack serves to compress the storage bag to thereby increase the pressure therein, so that the delay of the dispensing of the liquid does not increase over time as the bag becomes depleted. Also provided is a lower, pivotal tray located below the dispensing nozzle of the dispensing apparatus by which drippings and excess dispensed amounts are caught by the tray and do not fall upon the floor therebelow. A front cover is rotatable to an upper position such that it does not rotate back down by itself in order to allow unencumbered access to the interior of the apparatus for changing storage bags and batteries. The apparatus also contains an aerosol spray canister for spraying a sanitizing mist into the ambient surroundings after the apparatus has dispensed sanitizing fluid onto the hands.
