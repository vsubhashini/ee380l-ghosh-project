A method for recording data with recording means including an ink-jet recording device including a changeable ink cartridge, said method comprising the steps of: supplying electric power to the recording means in an operational mode in which first power supply means supplies the power to the recording means, and not supplying electric power in a stand-by mode in which the first power supply means does not supply the power to the recording means; detecting that the recording means starts recording the data; monitoring with monitoring means a change of the ink cartridge while the power supply means is in the stand-by mode, the monitoring means being supplied with sower by second power supply means; and controlling with control means the operational mode and the stand-by mode of the first power supply means in accordance with a result of said detecting step, and controlling the recording means to perform a recovery operation in accordance with a monitoring result of said monitoring step, wherein the first power supply means supplies sower to the control means while the first power supply means is in the operational mode, and the second power supply means does not supply power to the control means while the first power supply means is in the stand-by mode. 117. A method according to claim 116, further comprising the step of receiving the data, wherein the recording means records the data received in said receiving step. 118. A method according to claim 116, wherein the data comprises image data. 119. A method according to claim 116, wherein said method is effected in a facsimile apparatus. 120. A method according to claim 116, wherein said controlling step controls the recording means to perform the recovery operation when the mode of the power supply means changes from the stand-by mode to the operational mode after the ink cartridge is changed.
