The subject matter of the invention is an inverter (3), more specifically for use in a photovoltaic plant (1) with a direct voltage input (connection terminals 4; 5) for connection to a generator (2) and an alternating voltage output (connection terminals 7; 8) for feeding into an energy supply network (6) as well as with a DC-AC converter (12) with semiconductor switch elements (15) and an intermediate circuit (11), at least one short-circuit switch element (18) being connected in parallel to the generator (2), so that the voltage will not exceed a maximum voltage value neither at the connection terminals (4; 5) of the generator (2) nor between the connection terminals (9; 10) of the inverter. This is achieved in that the inverter (3) comprises, in the intermediate circuit (12), a buffer capacitor (14) that is connected to the generator (2) through a protection diode (17) so that said buffer capacitor (14) will not be discharged upon actuation of the short-circuit switch element (18), the generator (2) working according to a clock rate in the short-circuit mode of operation.
