An oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. Heat may be provided to the treatment area from one or more heat sources. A heat source may be positioned in an uncased wellbore. Heat may be allowed to transfer from the heat source to a section of the formation. Subsequently, hydrocarbons, H.sub.2, and/or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation.
