A louver solar panel comprising spaces parallel corrugated louvers extending between channel-like side members. The louvers have flat sided adjoining corrugations the sides of which are about equal in width and are about normal to one another. The louvers are oriented at angles of about 30.degree. with the lengths of the side members, do not overlap and have a heat absorbing surface on the sides thereof to be exposed to solar radiation.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar heating assembly suitable for mounting interiorly of a window opening, comprising: (a) at least two vertical support members, each member including an inner edge for orientation towards a source of solar energy and an outer edge spaced therefrom, and a web section connecting said inner and outer edges; (b) said members having vertically spaced, parallel louver receiving slots in said webs extending downwardly from said outer edges toward said inner edges, said slots opening at said outer edges and terminating short of said inner edges, and the slots of one member being is substantially parallel alignment with the slots of the other member; and, (c) a plurality of transversely extending corrugated louvers removably supportable in said slots of the vertical members, said louvers being slidably supported in said slots, said louvers being selectively removable and having their upper surfaces treated with a heat absorbing material and the lower surfaces being reflective of solar radiation and being corrugated transversely of their lengths to form a series of adjacent flat sections, the included angle between adjacent flat sections being substantially 90.degree.. 2. The solar heating assembly of claim 1 wherein ends of said louvers are configured so that the louver can be reversed in said slots so that said reflective surfaces reflect solar energy, when desired. 3. The solar heating assembly of claim 1 wherein the weight of said louvers maintains their positions in said slots. 4. A solar heating assembly mounted interiorly of a building, comprising: (a) at least two vertical support members fixedly positioned inside a window opening; (b) each member including vertically spaced, louver mounting means, the mounting means of one member being in substantially parallel alignment with the mounting means of the other member; (c) a plurality of corrugated louvers extending between and removably mounted in the mounting means of said vertical support members, the weight of said louvers maintaining their positions in said mounting means, said louvers being selectively removable and having upper and lower longitudinal edges, and louvers and said vertical support members being in open communication with the interior of said building; (d) said louvers having their upper surfaces treated with a heat absorbing material and being corrugated transversely of their lengths to form a series of adjacent flat sections, joined at a predetermined angle, said predetermined angle being substantially 90.degree.; and, (e) said louvers being inclined downwardly towards a window in said window opening when supported by said mounting means to present the maximum surface area to solar energy transmitted through said window opening, said lower longitudinal edges being nearer said window than said upper longitudinal edges so that air in the region between said window and said lower longitudinal edges of said louvers travels from said region along a path defined between adjacent louvers, rising upwardly along said upper surfaces to enter the interior of said building. 5. A solar heating assembly mounted interiorly of a building, comprising: (a) at least two vertical support members fixedly positioned inside a window opening; (b) said vertical support members each having an inner edge disposed adjacent a window in said window opening, an outer edge spaced away from said window, and a web connecting said inner and outer edges; (c) said members having vertically spaced, parallel louver receiving slots in said webs extending downwardly from said outer edges toward said inner edges, said slots opening at said outer edges and terminating short of said inner edges, and the slots of one member being in substantially parallel alignment with the slots of the other member; (d) a plurality of louvers extending between and removably inserted in associated slots of said vertical support members, said louvers being slidably supported in said slots, the weight of said louvers maintaining their positions in said slots; and, (e) said louvers having their upper surfaces treated with a heat absorbing material and being corrugated transversely of their lengths to form a series of adjacent flat sections, joined at a predetermined angle, said predetermined angle being substantially 90.degree..
