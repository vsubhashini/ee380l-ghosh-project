A holding device for an electronic thermometer (13) including a solar cell (20) and an electronic display (22) convexly formed on an outer surface (19) of the thermometer (13), characterised in that the holding device comprises an elongated receiving body (28, 128, 228) having inner and outer surfaces (30, 32), the surfaces having front and rear walls (34, 36) integrally connected by side walls (38, 40), the receiving body (28, 128, 228) having first and second ends, the first end having a bottom wall integrally connecting the front and rear walls (34, 36) to define a closed end (14), the second end defining an open end (16, 216) through which the thermometer (13) is disposed, the inner surface (30) of the holding device complementing the outer surface (19) of the electronic thermometer (13) to receive a portion of the thermometer (13), the front wall of the inner surface (30) being concavely formed to complement and receive the display (22) when the thermometer (13) is disposed in the receiving body, the receiving body (28, 128, 228) being configured to allow exposure of the solar cell (20) to receive solar energy therethrough when the thermometer (13) is in the holding device. 3. The device of claim 1 or 2 wherein the outer surface (32) of the receiving body (28, 228) includes a mounting device (44, 66) for mounting the holding device to a surface. 4. The device of claim 3 wherein the mounting device includes a pressure sensitive adhesive (44). 5. The device of claim 3 wherein the mounting device includes mounting screws (66) extending from its outer surface (32) for mounting into said surface. 6. The device of any preceding claim further comprising a foot (131) integrally attached to the receiving body (128); a base (135) to which the foot (131) removably attaches to hold the receiving body (28) at an angle sufficient to allow the solar cell (20) of the thermometer (13) to receive solar energy. 7. The device of claim 6 wherein the base (135) includes a groove (133) in which the foot (131) is disposed to be removably attached to the base (135). 8. The device of any preceding claim further comprising an electrical socket (218) formed sufficiently adjacent the open end (216) so that when a light bulb (215) is in electrical contact with the socket (218), energy emitted from the light bulb (215) is received by the solar cell (20), and a plug (231) extending from the outer surface (236) of the receiving body (228), the plug (231) being in electrical communication with the socket (218) to provide electrical power to the socket (218) to power a light bulb (215) in electrical contact with the socket (218) to provide solar energy to the solar cell (20) of the thermometer (13) extending through the open end (216). 9. The device of any preceding claim wherein the receiving body (28) further includes a support (48) extending from the open end (16) to provide support to the thermometer (13) when extending through the open end (16). 10. The device of any preceding claim wherein the receiving body (28, 128, 228) is configured to receive a first portion of the thermometer (13) and expose a second portion of the thermometer (13), the second portion including the solar cell (20). 11. An electronic thermometer holding assembly comprising an electronic thermometer (13), which has a solar cell (20) and an electronic display (22) convexly formed on an outer surface (19), and the holding device of any preceding claim.
