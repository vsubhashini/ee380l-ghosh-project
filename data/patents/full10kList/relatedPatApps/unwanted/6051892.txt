A micro hydroelectric power conversion system for supplying power to and driving an electrical system. The system includes first and second storage tanks each including a base side and a top side and positioned in a stacked relationship with each other such that the top side of the second storage tank faces the base side of the first storage tank. A pipeline connects the base of the first storage tank to the top side of the second storage tank and a penstock including a wheel and an electrical generator connected to the wheel is connected to the pipeline. A rechargeable power supply is connected to receive power from the electrical generator for storing the received power and selectively supplying the received power to the electrical system being driven. A return pipe is connected between the base side of the second storage tank and the top side of the first storage tank and a fluid is positioned within the system. A pump driven by an alternative power source is connected to the return pipe, wherein the first and second storage tanks, pipeline and feedback pipe form a sealed chamber with the fluid contained therein. When the pump is activated the fluid is caused to continually flow from the second storage tank through the return pipe into the first storage tank and through the pipeline back into the second storage tank whereby, as the fluid passes through the pipeline, the wheel is caused to turn driving the electrical generator to supply electrical energy to recharge the rechargeable power source.
Claims What is claimed is new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent is set forth in the appended claims: 1. A micro hydroelectric power conversion system comprising: a) a first storage tank including a base side and a top side; b) a second storage tank including a top side and a base side, said first and second storage tanks positioned in a stacked relationship with each other such that said top side of said second storage tank faces said base side of said first storage tank; c) a fluid; d) a pipeline connecting said base of said first storage tank to said top side of said second storage tank; e) a penstock including a wheel and an electrical generator connected to said wheel, said penstock being connected to said pipeline; f) a rechargeable power supply connected to receive power from said electrical generator for storing the received power and selectively supplying the received power to the electrical system being driven; g) a return pipe connected between said base side of said second storage tank and said top side of said first storage tank; h) a pump in said return pipe to cause said fluid to continually flow from said second storage tank through said return pipe into said first storage tank; i) in line educator means in said return pipe on the intake side of said pump for monitoring fluid pressure in said return pipe; j) a feedback pipe between said educator means and the outlet side of said pump for recycling fluid back to said educator means into said return pipe when said educator means determines that the fluid pressure within said pipeline at said educator means is below a predetermined value; k) a solar power generator for driving said pump; and l) said pipeline, first and second storage tanks, and feedback pipe form a sealed chamber with said fluid contained therein. 2. The micro hydroelectric power system as recited in claim 1, further comprising a plurality of storage tanks positioned in stacked relationship with each other between said first and second storage tanks, and a plurality of connecting pipes connecting adjacent ones of said plurality of storage tanks. 3. The micro hydroelectric power system as recited in claim 2, further comprising a plurality of penstocks, each penstock including a wheel and electrical generator and connected to a respective one of said plurality of connecting pipes, each electrical generator being connected to supply electrical power for recharging said power supply.
