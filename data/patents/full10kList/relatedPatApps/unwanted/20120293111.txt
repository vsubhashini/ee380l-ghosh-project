A mobile solar power-generating system includes a prismatic container (1) having a top wall (10), a bottom wall (11) and side walls. A central photovoltaic panel (6) is supported in a tiltable manner on the top wall (10) by supporting elements, on each of the sides of the central photovoltaic panel (6) being hinged a correspondent transversal photovoltaic panel (61, 62, 63, 64) hanging downward in a rest position and being able to rotate 90 degrees upward. On a side of each transversal photovoltaic panel is hinged a side photovoltaic panel (610, 620, 630, 640) that is designed to fold down with respect to the relevant transversal photovoltaic panel (61, 62, 63, 64). Mutual engagement elements are provided for keeping coplanar the transversal photovoltaic panels and the side photovoltaic panels to the central photovoltaic panel (6) when the power-generating system is in an operating position.
Claims 1-9. (canceled) 10. A mobile solar power-generating system comprising a prismatic container (1) internally housing at least a charge regulator (23) and at least an accumulator battery (3) and externally sustaining at least a central photovoltaic panel (6), the container (1) having a top wall (10), a bottom wall (11) and side walls (12, 13, 14, 15), and the central photovoltaic panel (6) being supported in a tiltable manner on the top wall (10) by supporting means, on each of the sides of the central photovoltaic (6) being hinged by hinges (7) a correspondent transversal photovoltaic panel (61, 62, 63, 64) hanging downward in a rest position and being able to rotate 90 degrees upward so that it is arranged coplanar to the central photovoltaic panel (6); characterised in that hinged by means of hinges (8) on a side of each transversal photovoltaic panel (61, 62, 63, 64), consecutive to the hinging side with the central photovoltaic panel (6), is a side photovoltaic panel (610, 620, 630, 640) that is designed to fold down with respect to the relevant transversal photovoltaic panel (61, 62, 63, 64); mutual engagement means being provided for keeping coplanar the transversal photovoltaic panels (61, 62, 63, 64) and the side photovoltaic panels (610, 620, 630, 640), to the central photovoltaic panel (6) when the power-generating system is in an operating position. 11.
