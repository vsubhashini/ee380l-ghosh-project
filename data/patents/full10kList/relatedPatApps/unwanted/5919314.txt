A sun tracking system and method for tracking the position of the sun. The sun tracking system includes an on-board computer for controlling each device; a solar array driving unit for rotating a solar array and for transmitting an array angle to the on-board computer; an array tilt mechanism for adjusting a tilt of the solar array and for transmitting an tilt angle to the on-board computer; the solar array connected to the solar array driving unit and to the array tilt mechanism, for supplying a current and a voltage to a peak power tracker; and the peak power tracker for supplying a power generated from the solar array to each part of a satellite and for supplying a peak power to the on-board computer.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for tracking the sun, comprising: an on-board computer for controlling each device, said on-board computer having an algorithm for tracking the position of the sun; a solar array driving unit for rotating a solar array and for transmitting an array angle to said on-board computer, said solar array driving unit being operated by a command of said on-board computer; an array tilt mechanism for adjusting a tilt of said solar array and for transmitting a tilt angle to said on-board computer, said array tilt mechanism being operated by a command of said on-board computer; said solar array connected to said solar array driving unit and to said array tilt mechanism, for supplying a current and a voltage to a peak power tracker; and said peak power tracker for supplying a power generated from said solar array to each part of a satellite and for supplying a peak power to said on-board computer; whereby the sun can be tracked by using the principle that the power generated from said solar array is inversely proportional to an angle between the sun and a normal surface of said solar array. 2. A method for tracking the sun, comprising the steps of: (a) rotating a solar array by operating a solar array driving unit from an on-board computer, and stopping said solar array driving unit at a peak power point by monitoring a power generated from said solar array, thus to obtain a first array angle .theta.A; (b) tilting said solar array by driving an array tilt mechanism from said on-board computer, and stopping said array tilt mechanism at the peak power point by monitoring the power, thus to obtain a first tilt angle .theta.B; (c) repeating said steps of (a) and (b) after a given time T to obtain a second array angle .theta.C and a second tilt angle .theta.D, and causing said solar array driving unit to rotate said solar array at a speed of (.theta.C-.theta.A)/T at a point of said second array angle .theta.C; and (d) causing said array tilt mechanism to tilt said solar array at a speed of (.theta.D-.theta.B)/T at a point of said second tilt angle .theta.D. 3. A method for tracking the sun as claimed in claim 2, wherein said step of rotating a solar array is implemented in such a way that if a variation of the power of said solar array is greater than 0, said solar array is rotated in the same direction, and if a variation of the power of said solar array is less than 0, said solar array is rotated in an opposite direction. 4. A method for tracking the sun as claimed in claim 2, wherein said step of tilting said solar array is implemented in such a way that if a variation of the power of said solar array is greater than 0, said solar array is tilted in the same direction, and if a variation of the power of said solar array is less than 0, said solar array is tilted in an opposite direction.
