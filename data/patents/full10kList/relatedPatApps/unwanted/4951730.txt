A window blind system for a window comprising a longitudinal casing which is arranged to be transversely fixed to a window frame above a window to be shaded, a roller blind mechanism carrying an opaque blind and mounted to the casing in a position under the casing and a driving assembly and a control circuit and a control unit for operating the roller mechanism unit to roll out or rewind the blind.
Claims I claim: 1. A window blind system for shading a window assembly comprising: a longitudinal casing having an open top portion defining a top chamber and a pair of opposed right-angled end portions extending downwardly defining a pair of side chambers in open communication with said top chamber; a cover member adapted for closing the opening in the top portion of the casing; means for securing the cover member to the casing; a roller blind mechanism carrying a blind and having a roller fitted with two spaced circular discs for retaining a wound blind therebetween; means for mounting said roller blind mechanism to the casing transversely between the right-angled end portions and under a longitudinal directed portion of the casing; power sources combining (1) a solar power system having a plurality of solar mirrors mounted in a side wall of the casing and exposed to the sunlight, (2) a home electric power system and, (3) a rechargeable battery power system mounted in the casing; driving means having a reversible power unit powered by the power sources combination and a driving unit engaged with the roller of the roller blind mechanism, said driving unit being mounted in one of said side chambers being coupled on opposing ends to said reversible power unit and said roller blind mechanism, said driving unit including a reduction gear mechanism for reducing the rotative speed of said power unit; and control means having a control circuit and control unit for operating the roller blind mechanism to roll out or rewind the blind.
