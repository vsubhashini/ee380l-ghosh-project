A point focus distributed receiver system for generating high-pressure steam by means of solar energy collection is disclosed. The cradle within which a gimbal mounted concentrator dish rotates is designed to withstand high wind forces by delivering all forces along the polar axis to the equatorial end of the cradle, requires only one structural member to withstand flexural forces and provides an unobstructed volume behind the axis of rotation for the concentrator dish to rotate in.
