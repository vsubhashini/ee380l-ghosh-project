An evacuated, double wall, tubular solar energy collector having a concave, specular reflecting surface corresponding to a segment of a cylinder positioned at the opposite side of the collector tube from the sun. The reflector is detachably connected to the tube and the tube is engaged by raised spacing points on the reflector to provide the proper spaced relation between them and allow for water drainage along the reflector. Plural units of the collector tube and cylindrically-shaped reflector combination are supported along opposite sides of an elongated manifold for circulation of an energy absorbing media through them. This system improves the efficiency of total energy collection without tracking the sun or focusing the reflected radiation. The tubes are no more than three diameters apart and the cylindrical reflector has its focal line within the absorbing area of the collector tube. The radius of curvature of the reflector surface exceeds the radius of the tube and is defined as a function of the tube diameter and tube spacing.
