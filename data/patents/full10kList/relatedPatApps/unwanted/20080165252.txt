The monitoring system according to claim 1, wherein: said operating-conditions transmission unit includes: a tracking unit which tracks a movable body existing in a received picture image; and a unit which, on the basis of the information received from the tracking means, changes an image taking range of each of the plurality of existing imaging devices so that an image of the movable body is taken. 7. The monitoring system according to claim 1, wherein: said operating-conditions transmission unit includes a unit which, when the output of the unit which detects the occurrence of an abnormal state from the picture image is a signal that indicates an abnormal state, transmits an instruction to take an image of an area, in which the abnormal state has occurred, by use of the imaging devices existing around the area. 8. The monitoring system according to claim 1, wherein: said imaging device includes a unit which provides the power supply to the image taking unit from a power supply unit that differs from a power supply unit for providing the power supply to the unit which enables movement to an arbitrary position. 9. The monitoring system according to claim 8, wherein the power supply of the image taking unit is a solar battery. 10. The monitoring system according to claim 1, said monitoring system further comprising: a unit that operates only when the movable body equipped with the imaging device is kept in a parked state. 11. A monitoring system comprising a plurality of movable bodies, each of which includes an image taking unit, and a control device which communicates with the plurality of movable bodies, said movable body including: a first communication unit which communicates with the control device; an image-taking-direction changing unit which changes an image taking direction of the image taking unit; and a first control unit; said control device including: a second communication unit which communicates with the movable bodies; a detection unit which detects the occurrence of an abnormal state by use of a picture image taken by the image taking unit; an informing unit which informs a contact of the occurrence of the abnormal state; and a second control unit; wherein when the movable body enters an area around a target to be monitored, the first control unit included in the movable body controls the first communication unit so that the first communication unit communicates with the control device; wherein in response to the communications with the movable body, the second control unit included in the control device determines an image taking range within which the movable body takes a picture image, and then controls the second communication unit so that the second communication unit communicates with the movable body to provide the movable body with information about the image taking range; and wherein the first control unit included in the movable body uses the information about the image taking range to control the image-taking-direction changing unit so that the image taking unit takes a picture image over the image taking range. 12. A movable body included in a monitoring system, said monitoring system comprising: a plurality of movable bodies, each of which includes image taking unit; and a control device including: a second communication unit which communicates with the plurality of movable bodies; a detection unit which detects the occurrence of an abnormal state by use of a picture image taken by the image taking unit; an informing unit which informs a contact of the occurrence of the abnormal state; and a second control unit; said movable body further including: a first communication unit which communicates with the control device; an image-taking-direction changing unit which changes an image taking direction of the image taking unit; and a first control unit; wherein when the movable body enters an area around a target to be monitored, the first control unit included in the movable body controls the first communication unit so that the first communication unit communicates with the control device; wherein in response to the communications with the movable body, the second control unit included in the control device determines an image taking range within which the movable body takes a picture image, and then controls the second communication unit so that the second communication unit communicates with the movable body to provide the movable body with information about the image taking range; and wherein the first control unit included in the movable body uses the information about the image taking range to control the image-taking-direction changing unit so that the image taking unit takes a picture image over the image taking range. 13.
