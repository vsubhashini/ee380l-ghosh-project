A compact attic mounted solar heating pack assembly includes an enclosed sheet metal plenum fixedly hung by straps from the attic rafters at the apex of north and south facing roofing sections. An electric powered blower fixed to the plenum has an air inlet open to the attic interior below the south facing roof section. An air outlet of the blower opens directly to the plenum interior. A plurality of flexible ducts are coupled to respective air outlets within the plenum at one end with their opposite ends terminating in diffusers mountable within holes formed within the underlying ceiling for delivering air from the plenum chamber directly to the building interior below the attic floor. A first normally open cooling thermostat is mounted within the attic at the apex, beneath the south facing roof section. A plastic heat barrier is hung from the ridge pole and extends well elbow the plenum chamber to trap heated air within the section of the attic beneath the south facing wall. A second heating thermostat is mounted within the building interior below the ceiling and preferably on an interior partition wall and is series connected with the blower motor and the first attic mounted thermostat and connectable to a source of electrical current. The normally open thermostat closes when room heat is needed and the temperature in the attic is above 70 degrees to provide an effective independent supplementary heating unit for the building.
