The invention relates to piggyback secondary payloads, a device for and a method of attaching piggyback secondary payloads, including a primary satellite and at least one secondary payload, such as a deployable microsatellite, affixed instrument package or the like, wherein the secondary payload is mounted on the nadir end of the primary satellite, preferably employing a universal adapter between the primary satellite and the at least one secondary payload.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A piggyback satellite arrangement for launch from the earth surface by a launch vehicle, comprising: a primary satellite having a nadir end and an apogee end, deployable telecommunications antennae, deployable solar panels and a primary satellite propulsion system disposed at the apogee end and operative to lift the primary satellite into geostationary orbit after separation from the launch vehicle; a plurality of secondary payloads, said plurality of secondary payloads comprising at least one secondary micro-satellite, each secondary payload having a mounted end and an axially opposite end; and a plurality of adapters, each comprising a first coupling structure affixed to the nadir end of the primary satellite and a second coupling structure affixed to the mounted end of the secondary payload, wherein each of the plurality of secondary payloads is affixed at its mounted end to the nadir end of the primary satellite by the adapters for release from the launch vehicle as a combined package, at least said adapter coupled to said secondary microsatellite being controllable for separation of the secondary micro-satellite from the primary satellite after being released from the launch vehicle as a combined package without the generation of space debris, and other of said plurality of adapters being operative to secure said secondary payloads to the primary satellite while in orbit. 2. The piggyback satellite arrangement as in claim 1, wherein the primary satellite comprises a substantially cylinder-shaped support structure extending from the nadir end to an apogee end of the primary satellite and being operative to provide strength and stability to the primary satellite parallel to a central axis. 3. The satellite arrangement device as in claim 1, wherein the adapter further comprises a clamp for coupling the first coupling structure to the second coupling structure. 4. The satellite arrangement device as in claim 1, wherein the at least one secondary payload further comprises: at least one of an instrument package, equipment panel, antenna system, and any combination thereof. 5. The satellite arrangement device as in claim 1, wherein the adapter further comprises an interface which may provide at least one of power, telemetry and command communications between the primary satellite and the secondary micro-satellite. 6. A method of assembling at least a primary satellite and a plurality of secondary payloads as a combined package arranged in a piggyback configuration with a launch vehicle operative to launch said combined package from the earth surface, the method comprising: providing the primary satellite having a nadir end and an apogee end, said primary satellite being equipped with deployable telecommunications antennae, deployable solar panels and a primary satellite propulsion system at the apogee end that is operative to lift the primary satellite into geostationary orbit after separation from the launch vehicle, and being equipped with at least one first coupling structure, each said at least one first coupling structure mating to a respective one of a plurality of second coupling structures to form a releaseable adaptor that, when released in orbit, does not generate space debris; providing a plurality of secondary payloads, including a secondary micro-satellite, each secondary payload having mountable end and being equipped with said second coupling structure, wherein each of said first coupling structures is disposed on the nadir end of the primary satellite and positioned for support by the primary satellite support structure, and each of the second coupling structure is disposed on the mountable end portion of the respective secondary payload, securing the first coupling structure to the second coupling structure prior to launch, thereby affixing the apogee end of the secondary payload to the nadir end of the primary satellite using the adapter and forming a combined launch package, and mounting the combined launch package into a single storage area of the launch vehicle for subsequent release from said vehicle as a combined launch package. 7. The method of assembling a piggyback secondary payload as recited in claim 6 further comprising: providing power to the secondary micro-satellite from the primary satellite via an interface in the adapter; and providing at least one of telemetry and command communication between the secondary micro-satellite and the primary satellite via an interface in the adapter. 8. The method of assembling a piggyback satellite with secondary payloads as in claim 6, further comprising affixing a plurality of secondary payloads onto the nadir end of the primary satellite using plural adapters.
