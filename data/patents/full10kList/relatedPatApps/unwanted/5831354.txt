A bootstrap propulsion system is provided including a housing with a pair of elliptical track assemblies situated side-by-side within the housing and further positioned in a common plane. A moving mass assembly is situated on each of the track assemblies. The moving mass assemblies are each adapted to move around the associated track assembly such that an instantaneous position thereof on the associated track assembly is a mirror image of that of the other moving mass assembly within the same compartment of the housing. In order reduce the weight of the overall system, movement of the moving mass assemblies is effected by way of a linear motor.
