The energy conversion system includes a photo-voltaic array for receiving solar radiation and converting such radiation to electrical energy. The photo-voltaic array is mounted on a stretched membrane that is held by a frame. Tracking means for orienting the photo-voltaic array in predetermined positions that provide optimal exposure to solar radiation cooperate with the frame. An enclosure formed of a radiation transmissible material includes an inside containment space that accommodates the photo-voltaic array on the stretched membrane, the frame and the tracking means, and forms a protective shield for all such components. The enclosure is preferably formed of a flexible inflatable material and maintains its preferred form, such as a dome, under the influence of a low air pressure furnished to the dome. Under this arrangement the energy conversion system is streamlined for minimizing wind resistance, sufficiently weatherproof for providing protection against weather hazards such as hail, capable of using diffused light, lightweight for low-cost construction, and operational with a minimal power draw.

The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said rim is substantially circular and positioned substantially concentric with said dome enclosure and said substrate is stretched in a flat plane over said rim and the photovoltaic cells of said array are mounted in said chamber on said substrate film in such a manner that they are exposed directly to solar radiation, including scattered solar radiation, in the chamber with no intervening lens, solid light conductors, and light shielding over the photovoltaic cells. 3. The apparatus of claim 2, including tracking drive means positioned in said chamber and connected mechanically to said support means for maintaining said array approximately facing the sun and connected electrically to said array for powering said tracking drive means with electrical energy produced by said array, and including inflating means positioned adjacent said dome for blowing air into said dome to maintain said pressure therein, said inflating means also being connected electrically to said array for powering said inflating means with electrical power produced by said array. 4. The apparatus of claim 3, including a substantially circular base, said support means being anchored in said base, and said base having an annular collar around its periphery, the edges of said thin film material of said dome being draped over said collar and clamped to the base by a substantially circular clamp abutted against the collar with the thin film dome material positioned between the clamp and the collar. 5. A method of converting solar radiation from the sun to electrical energy, comprising the steps of: stretching a thin film membrane substrate over a substantially circular frame and affixing the substrate in stretched condition to said frame to form a flat planar substrate in the scope of a circle; mounting a plurality of photovoltaic cells in an array on one side of said flat planar substrate and electrically connecting them together to arrange said array into an electric power source; mounting said frame on a support structure that is strong enough to support the frame, substrate membrane, and array in a still environment but not designed and built strong enough to support these components under wind and hail loads and which is capable of adjusting said array about two orthogonal axes and adjusting the support structure to maintain the array oriented approximately perpendicular to a line extending between the sun and the center of the array; positioning a large, flexible, thin film enclosure membrane that is tear resistant and specularly translucent concentrically over said array, to enclose said array, substrate, frame, and support structure assembly, sealing the edges of the enclosure membrane, and inflating the enclosure to form an interior chamber over and around said assembly that is enclosed by the enclosure membrane, and maintaining the pressure inside the chamber to a sufficient amount to support the enclosure film in a semi-rigid structure over the assembly. 6. The method of claim 5 including the steps of mounting the support structure on a rigid circular base and fastening and sealing the edges of the enclosure membrane around the periphery of the circular base by draping the edges over an annular collar around the periphery and clamping the edges between the collar and a clamping ring. 7. The method of claim 5, including the steps of connecting electrically powered drive means to said support structure, powering said drive means with electric power produced by said array, and controlling the drive means to adjust the orientation of the array automatically to maintain said perpendicular relation between the array and the sun. 8. The method of claim 7, including the steps of maintaining said pressure in said chamber by positioning an electrically powered blower adjacent said enclosure with a duct connecting the blower to the interior chamber and powering said blower with electrical power produced by said array.
