Structure according to claim 1, characterized in that the core (31) of an upright (3) comprises at least one gutter (35, 36) extending along the entire length of the upright. 3. Structure according to claim 2, characterized in that the gutter (35, 36) is delimited by at least one rib (34) extending over the entire length of the upright. 4. Structure according to claim 2, characterized in that the core (40) of a crossbar (4) comprises at least one opening (48) intended to open above the gutter (35, 36) of an upright (3) on which the crossbar rests. 5. Structure according to claim 4, characterized in that the core (40) of a crossbar (4) is shaped in such a way as to have, in the axial part thereof, at least in the region of intersection with an upright (3), a contact face projecting in the same direction as the wings. 6. Structure according to claim 1, characterized in that a side wing (41) of a crossbar (4) is inclined towards the interior of the crossbar in such a way as to allow the attachment of a frame held by the structure. 7. Structure according to claim 1, characterized in that the means for fixing at least one frame on the carcass comprise anchoring devices (10, 11) and fixing beadings (62) held by the anchoring devices (10, 11) and extending above the uprights (3), the anchoring devices (10, 11) and the fixing beadings (62) being provided in such a way that the fixing beadings (62) come into contact at least with the upper face of an edge of a frame (50A, 50B). 8. Structure according to claim 7, characterized in that at least one fixing means (10) comprises a locking head (80) in the upper part thereof, and in that the fixing beading (62) comprises a locking lug (70) adapted to be clipped onto the locking head (80). 9. Structure according to claim 7, characterized in that at least one fixing means (11) comprises a screw head (91) in the upper part thereof, and in that the fixing beading (62) comprises at one end thereof a screw paddle (65) adapted to be fixed to the screw head by means of a screw (90), and in that the fixing beading (62) comprises at the other end thereof a cover paddle (68) comprising a clipping lug adapted to be clipped onto a screw paddle. 10. Structure according to claim 8, characterized in that the fixing means (10, 11) consists of a screw body (100) comprising a distal screw spindle (101) for screwing into a structural element of the wall of a building and a proximal screw spindle (102) separated from the distal screw spindle by a means (103) for driving the screw body, and of a spacer (12, 13) adapted to be screwed onto the proximal screw spindle of the screw body, the spacer (12, 13) comprising a locking head (80) or screw head (91). 11. Structure according to claim 7, characterized in that the fixing beadings (62) are adapted to extend on either side of a region (61) separating two adjacent frames (50A, 50B), in such a way as to provide tight covering of the separation region of the frames. 12. Building wall characterized in that it comprises a structure according to claim 1. 13. Building wall according to claim 12, characterized in that it forms a roof pan and in that it comprises parallel beams (6), and in that the uprights (3) of the structure extend along parallel beams (6) and are fixed to the parallel beams. 14.
