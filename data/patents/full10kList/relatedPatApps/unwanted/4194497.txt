A method for installing solar collector panels as part of the roof of a building. Chalk lines are scribed on the roof to define the center of each vertical roof joist and to define the upper and lower extremes of the roof over which the solar collector panels are to be mounted. Upper and lower mounting brackets are aligned along the upper and lower horizontal scribed chalk lines and are attached through the roof to the joists as determined by the vertical chalk lines. Vertical rails are then mounted between the upper and lower brackets, aligned over the vertically scribed lines and mounted to the joists. One or a plurality of the solar collector panels are then installed between the vertical rails and between the upper and lower brackets. Cover and weather sealing plates are then installed to protect the mounting system and the solar collector panels from the environment.
