A trash compactor designed for public use is powered by a photovoltaic cell array. This allows the trash compactor to be placed in locations where no power is available, but with frequent human traffic. The compaction feature allows the unit to be emptied less often than a typical trash container. The trash compactor can include a storage system to store power for compaction cycles. A removable bin allows easy removal of the compacted trash. The removable bin can include multiple chambers for different trash types.
