A solar ray collector device suitable for use in an equatorial zone is disclosed which includes a number of collector units mounted on a framework. The framework is angularly movable in the east-and-west direction about a shaft which extends in the north-and-south direction. Each of the collector units is rotatable about a shaft which is parallel to the shaft extending in the north-and-south direction. The framework is supported by a post which is rotatable about an axis thereof.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar ray collector device for use in a equatorial zone comprising a post rotatable about a first axis, means for rotating said post, a framework, framework mounting means mounting said framework on said post, said framework mounting means comprising a shaft rotatable about a second axis which is perpendicular to said first axis, said shaft being mounted on said post so that said shaft rotates with said post about said first axis, said framework being mounted on said shaft to provide for rotation of said framework about said second axis, said first axis being a vertical axis and said second axis extending in a north-and-south direction, framework drive means for rotating said framework about said second axis, a plurality of collector units mounted on said framework, each of said collector units having a transparent housing and a collector assembly mounted in said housing, rotatable mounting means mounting each of said collector assemblies on said framework for rotation about collector axes parallel to said second axis, collector drive means for rotating said collector assemblies about said collector axes, said transparent housings each having at least a partial cylindrical configuration with the axis of the cylinder extending parallel to said second axis, the sunlight being admitted into said housing to be collected by said collector assemblies without being totally reflected by the surface of said housing, said collector drive means rotating said collector assemblies about said collector axes to direct said collector assemblies toward the sun as the latter passes overhead from east to west, said framework drive means rotating said framework about said second axis to allow said collector devices to collect solar rays without shading one another, whereby, when used in an equatorial zone, solar rays of the equatorial zone sun will be admitted into said housing without being reflected by the surface of the housing even when said axes of said at least partial cylindrical surfaces are disposed horizontally in a north-and-south direction. 2. A solar ray collector device according to claim 1, wherein said housing has a semicircular cross-sectional configuration. 3. A solar ray collector device according to claim 1, wherein said housing has a cylindrical configuration. 4. A solar ray collector device according to claim 1, wherein each of said collector assemblies comprises a plurality of lenses, light transmitting members each aligned at one end thereof at a focal point of said plurality of lenses to receive light which is converged by said lens, said housing covering the surfaces of said lenses. 5. A solar ray collector device according to claim 4, wherein said light transmitting members pass through longitudinal passages in said post and in said shaft, and further comprising a collector shaft on which said collector assemblies are mounted, said light transmitting members passing through longitudinal passages in said collector shafts. 6. A solar ray collector device according to claim 1, wherein said housing and said collector assembly of each of said collector units are joined together as a unit so that said housing and collector assembly rotate together as a unit. 7. A solar ray collector device for use in an equitorial zone comprising a post rotatable about a first axis, means for rotating said post, a framework, framework mounting means mounting said framework on said post, said framework mounting means comprising a shaft rotatable about a second axis which is perpendicular to said first axis, said shaft being mounted on said post so that said shaft rotates with said post about said first axis, said framework being mounted on said shaft to provide for rotation of said framework about said second axis, said first axis being a vertical axis and said second axis extending in a north-and-south direction, framework drive means for rotating said framework about said second axis, a plurality of collector units mounted on said framework, each of said collector units having a transparent housing and a collector assembly mounted in said housing, rotatable mounting means mounting each of said collector assemblies on said framework for rotation about collector axes disposed parallel to said second axis, collector drive means for rotating said collector assemblies about said collector axes, said transparent housings each having a cylindrical configuration with the axis of the cylinder extending parallel to said second axis, the sunlight being admitted into said housing to be collected by said collector assemblies without being totally reflected by the surface of said housing, said collector drive means rotating said collector assemblies about said collector axes to direct said collector assemblies toward the sun as the latter passes overhead from east to west, said framework drive means rotating said framework about said second axis to allow said collector devices to collect solar rays without shading one another, whereby, when used in an equatorial zone wherein the angular movement of the sun relative to the north-and-south direction is at a minimum, solar rays directed from such a north-and-south angular range toward the solar collector will be admitted into said housing without being reflected by the surface of the housing even when said axes of said at least partial cylindrical surfaces are disposed horizontally in a north-and-south direction.
