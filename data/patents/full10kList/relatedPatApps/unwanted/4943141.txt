A solar ray collecting device comprises a solar ray collecting portion including a number of solar ray collecting elements, a transparent dome for covering the solar ray collecting portion, a base plate for supporting the dome, a first-revolution shaft for rotating the base plate, a support arm for supporting the first-revolution shaft and a second-revolution shaft for rotating the support arm around an axis being perpendicular to that of the first revolution shaft. The first revolution shaft and the second revolution shaft are controlled in such a way as to direct the light receiving surface of the lens system toward the sun to introduce solar rays into the optic fiber cable. Each solar ray collecting element is provided with a correct mounting means for setting the light-receiving surface of the element at a right angle to the light that has passed through the dome.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar ray collecting device comprising a solar ray collecting means comprising a plurality of solar ray collecting elements, each of said elements consisting of a lens for focusing solar rays and an optic fiber cable having a light-receiving end located at the focal point of said lens, a transparent dome for covering said solar ray collecting means, a base plate for supporting said dome, a first-revolution shaft for rotating said base plate, a support arm for supporting said first-revolution shaft and a second-revolution shaft for rotating said support arm around an axis which is perpendicular to the axis of the first-revolution shaft, wherein the first-revolution shaft and the second-revolution shaft are controlled in such a way as to direct the light-receiving surface of said lens toward the sun to introduce solar rays into the optic fiber cable in order to transmit said solar rays therethrough to any place where the light is needed, characterized in that each of said solar ray collecting elements is provided with a correct mounting means for setting said light-receiving surface of said lens at a right angle to the light that has passed through said dome. 2. A solar ray collecting device, according to claim 1, characterized in that the correct mounting means comprises a setting plate having a concave surface at its light-receiving side.
