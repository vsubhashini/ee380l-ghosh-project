A road marker according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention has advantages that exterior impact transmitted from a tire may be absorbed by elastic force of a spring as a consequence of a transparent cover being completely inserted in an upper housing when a vehicle passes on a road marker. The road marker has further advantages in that a vehicle load may not be transmitted to a guide cover and thus breakage of the road marker may be prevented.
