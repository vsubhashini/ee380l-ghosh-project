A solar powered sign annunciator comprised of a plurality of high intensity light emitting diodes (LED); a microprocessor controller to regulate power consumption and annunciator characteristics, battery charging and sensor response with an integrated software charge controller; a minimalized solar panel array sized to produce sufficient power for battery charging under normalized solar radiation to latitudes as far north as 45 degrees; a direction sensing Doppler radar to determine the approach of traffic; a low voltage battery to minimize power control losses to the LED array; a temperature sensor to determine proper charging battery status and battery capacity; and a plurality of analog to digital (A/D) converters incorporated in the microprocessor to sense solar power output, temperature input, battery voltage and charging current and Doppler phase shift differential. The system also includes a housing arrangement to incorporate all aforementioned items in a weathertight enclosure providing sufficient horizontal surface for solar cell attachment yet in a package compact enough to easily attach to existing designed signs.
Claims I claim: 1. An enhanced sign comprising: a) a sign panel modified to allow a plurality of high intensity LEDs to protrude through the sign fascia so as to be visible from the front; b) a microprocessor controller to direct all sign functions to control power usage, LED flash rate and timing, and battery charging; c) a plurality of forward facing high intensity light emitting diodes arranged in a pattern to represent letters or numbers or other sign indicia, the LEDs mounted to a printed circuit board, the printed circuit board with a prearranged standard pattern allowing the creation of any combination of letters, numbers or symbols; d) a housing disposed behind the rear of the sign fascia containing all electronics, batteries and circuit board, the top which forms the support for the solar panel array, the housing which is predrilled for sign mounting; e) a solar cell panel consisting of a plurality of cells connected in series, the panel electrically connected and controlled by the charge controller; f) a long range radar detector disposed within the housing and connected to the microprocessor for control; g) a low voltage battery sized to produce enough energy to power the LED array a predetermined number of times, to be recharged with the available solar energy available through said solar panel; h) a temperature sensor to determine ambient temperature; i) a microprocessor battery supply to operate said microprocessor independently of the low voltage battery; j) an integrated random access memory (RAM) to allow additional storage of operational data for later retrieval. k) an integrated communication port allowing for external communication to the microprocessor for data retrieval and upload of modification to operating parameters. 2. An enhanced sign as in claim 1, wherein said sign is a traffic safety sign.
