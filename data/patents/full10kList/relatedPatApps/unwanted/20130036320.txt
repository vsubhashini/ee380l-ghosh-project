Claims 1. An image forming apparatus comprising: a main power supply configured to feed power to components of the image forming apparatus; a secondary battery configured to be charged with power from the main power supply or a solar battery; a secondary battery deterioration detector configured to monitor a charging voltage drop of the secondary battery and to detect deterioration of the secondary battery; a secondary battery charge unit configured to charge the secondary battery when the secondary battery deterioration detector detects deterioration of the secondary battery in an energy-saving mode; and an energy-saving mode control unit configured to switch a power source for the image forming apparatus from the secondary battery to the main power supply to continue in the energy-saving mode when the secondary battery deterioration detector detects deterioration of the secondary battery in the energy-saving mode. 2. The image forming apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a storage unit configured to store therein the number of times the secondary battery is charged by the secondary battery charge unit during a predetermined period in the energy-saving mode and a reference number of times a normal battery would be forcibly charged during the predetermined period, wherein the secondary battery deterioration detector compares the number of times the secondary battery is charged during the predetermined period in the energy-saving mode with the reference number of times, to detect deterioration of the secondary battery. 3. The image forming apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a storage unit configured to store therein an available time for the secondary battery from completion of charging to the start of next charging during a predetermined period in the energy-saving mode, wherein when the available time exceeds a predetermined allowable range, the secondary battery deterioration detector determines that the secondary battery deteriorates. 4. The image forming apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a storage unit that stores therein a charge completion time of the secondary battery from the start of charging to completion of charging during a predetermined period in the energy-saving mode, wherein when the charge completion time exceeds a predetermined allowable range, the secondary battery deterioration detector detects that the secondary battery deteriorates. 5. The image forming apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a storage unit configured to store therein the number of times a sudden voltage reduction occurs in the secondary battery during a predetermined period in the energy-saving mode, wherein when the number of times a sudden voltage reduction occurs is equal to or more than a predetermined number of times, the secondary battery deterioration detector detects that the secondary battery deteriorates. 6. The image forming apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a notification unit configured to notify a user of an appropriate period of replacement of the secondary battery when the secondary battery deterioration detector detects that the secondary battery deteriorates. 7. A feeding control method performed by an image forming apparatus that includes a main power supply configured to feed power to components of the image forming apparatus and a secondary battery configured to be charged with power from the main power supply or a solar battery, the feeding control method comprising: detecting deterioration of the secondary battery by monitoring a charging voltage drop of the secondary battery; charging the secondary battery when deterioration of the secondary battery is detected in an energy-saving mode; and switching a power source for the image forming apparatus from the secondary battery to the main power supply to continue in the energy-saving mode when deterioration of the secondary battery is detected in the energy-saving mode. 8. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable medium including programmed instructions, wherein the instructions, when executed by a processor of an image forming apparatus that includes a main power supply configured to feed power to components of the image forming apparatus and a secondary battery configured to be charged with power from the main power supply or a solar battery, cause the processor to execute: detecting deterioration of the secondary battery by monitoring a charging voltage drop of the secondary battery; charging the secondary battery when deterioration of the secondary battery is detected in an energy-saving mode; and switching a power source for the image forming apparatus from the secondary battery to the main power supply to continue in the energy-saving mode when deterioration of the secondary battery is detected in the energy-saving mode.
