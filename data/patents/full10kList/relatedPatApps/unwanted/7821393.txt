A multivariate environmental sensing system with redundant transmission pathways with a network of nodes detecting environmental conditions and processing a transmissible signal. Nodes use predetermined criteria to make periodic detections, maintaining a low power state between detections. Power is conserved by deciding whether detections are transmitted immediately, or may be stored for periodic transmission. The nodes power up and immediately transmit urgent detections, storing routine detections for delayed batch transmission. Nodes may transmit signals received from other nodes, passing along signals received from more distant nodes. Transmission may have a predetermined pattern, but the system alters this pattern if there is disruption to the system or pattern. Gateways process data from nodes and pass data to other gateways, on an immediate or deferred basis, to a control center, where data is analyzed. Control centers transmit programming instruction to the gateways and nodes in a retrograde fashion along the transmission pathways.
