This invention comprises a light weight, inexpensive solar energy collector having an elongated arcuate reflecting member which can be used as an independent energy collector or in combination with other, similar units.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar heat energy collector comprising; a pair of axially spaced-apart collector supporting plates, each of said plates having an arcuate base portion, an arcuate reflecting shell member secured to the arcuate base portions of said collector supporting plates, a frame for cooperatively supporting and pivotally mounting said supporting plates in spaced relation to said reflecting member, a heat collecting member extending axially and parallel to said arcuate reflecting member and equiradially spaced therefrom, said heat collecting member being supported on each frame and circumscribed by said collector supporting plates, said heat collecting member having a fluid passageway extending longitudinally therethrough, a disengageable collecting member securing means attaching said collector member to said supporting plates, a fluid transfer medium retained for flow through said heat collecting member, and heat transfer means supported in its said heat collecting means in the path of flow of said fluid whereby solar energy reflected from said arcuate reflecting shell member will be transmitted to said fluid through said heat collecting means and heat transfer means to said fluid transfer medium flowing through said heat collecting means. 2. A solar heat energy collector as claimed in claim 1, wherein said heat transfer means comprises a plurality of longitudinally extending spaced-apart rib members. 3. A solar heat energy collector as claimed in claim 2, wherein said rib members are radially positioned in said fluid passageway. 4. A solar heat energy collector as claimed in claim 1, wherein said arcuate reflecting shell member comprises a polished aluminum sheet. 5. A solar heat energy collector as claimed in claim 1, wherein said fluid medium comprises water. 6. A solar heat energy collector as claimed in claim 1, wherein said fluid medium comprises a gas. 7. A solar heat energy collector as claimed in claim 6, wherein said gas comprises air. 8. A solar heat energy collector comrising a plurality of individual solar heat energy collectors as claimed in claim 1, said individual collectors being cooperatively connected and movable in unison and means for rotating at least one of said individual collectors. 9. A solar heat energy collector as claimed in claim 8, wherein said fluid passageways of said individual solar heat energy collectors are in fluid communication.
