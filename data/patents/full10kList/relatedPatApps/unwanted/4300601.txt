A removable vacuum indicator valve, horizontally affixed to the outside of an evacuated container, such as a flat-plate solar energy collector, wherein a movable sphere inside the valve is positioned to open or close the valve by the force of gravity or atmospheric pressure. The sphere, in open position, indicates the loss of vacuum and completes an electrical circuit which automatically activates a pump for restoring the vacuum to the container. The vacuum indicator valve, in combination with a normally closed valve installed permanently inside the evacuated container, and a remote electrically activated vacuum pumping system, provides a simple, inexpensive method for permanently maintaining and monitoring the vacuum in the container.
Claims What I claim is: 1. In an evacuated, flat-plate solar collector, including an airtight outer frame wherein a space within the frame is substantially evacuated, the improvement for preventing the loss of vacuum within said space which permits the evacuation of said space, in the event of loss of vacuum, comprising: a non-automatic valve, permanently attached to said frame by an airtight means, covering an exterior opening in said frame, said valve including a movable cover normally closing the aperture into the evacuated space, said cover being openable by the insertion of a suitably configured evacuating device. 2. An evacuated flat-plate solar collector as set forth in claim 1, wherein: said device is a vacuum-indicating sensor. 3. In an evacuated flat-plate solar collector, including an airtight outer frame wherein a space within the frame is substantially evacuated, the improvement for indicating the loss of vacuum within such space, comprising: a valve attachable to the outside of the evacuated frame in an airtight manner and positionable in a generally horizontal position, said valve having an outer, non-porous body with a central orifice leading from an internal chamber to the evacuated frame and said chamber leading externally to atmospheric pressure, said orifice having a distal end connectable to the evacuated frame, said chamber having at least one wall converging towards said orifice, said valve including an unattached sphere within said chamber, said sphere being a closure for said orifice and positionable in airtight contact with said orifice by force of atmospheric pressure, said sphere being free to be released from said orifice by gravitational force, said sphere movable along the incline of said chamber wall upon the loss of vacuum in said orifice, and wherein said outer body of said valve is a transparent plastic material. 4. In an evacuated, flat-plate solar collector, including an airtight outer frame wherein a space within the frame is substantially evacuated, the improvement for preventing the loss of vacuum within said space which permits the evacuation of said space, in the event of loss of vacuum, comprising: a vacuum monitoring and pumping system; a pressure-indicating, electrically-operated sensor connected to said frame and said vacuum monitoring and pumping system; an airtight hose connected at one end to said frame and at the other end connected to said vacuum monitoring and pumping system whereby said system is activated by said sensor to evacuate said frame upon the loss of vacuum within said frame. 5. An evacuated flat-plate solar collector as set forth in claim 4, wherein said pressure-indicating, electrically-operated sensor connected to said frame and said vacuum monitoring and pumping system comprises: a valve attached to said frame in an airtight manner and positionable in a generally horizontal position, said valve having an outer, non-porous body with a central orifice leading from an internal chamber to the evacuated frame and said chamber leading externally to atmospheric pressure, said orifice having a distal end connected to the evacuated frame, said chamber having at least one wall converging towards said orifice, said valve including an unattached sphere within said chamber, said sphere being a closure for said orifice and positionable in airtight contact with said orifice by force of atmospheric pressure, said sphere being free to be released from said orifice by gravitational force, said sphere movable along the incline of said chamber wall upon the loss of vacuum in said orifice, said sphere being composed of an electrically-conductive material and said chamber being composed of two, separated, electrically-conductive materials, each being connected to a terminal external of said outer body, and whereby the movement of said sphere away from said orifice completes an electrical circuit between said electrically-conductive chamber materials.
