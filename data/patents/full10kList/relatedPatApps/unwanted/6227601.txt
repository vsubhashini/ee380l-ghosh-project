A motor driven sunshield for permanent installation within the interior of an automotive vehicle, securely attached to the roof of the vehicle between the roof interior surface and the interior roof lining. Operable in either manual or semi-automatic mode, the sunshield can be deployed while the vehicle transmission is in PARK mode to cover the windshield of the vehicle for preventing potentially damaging solar radiation from entering the interior of the vehicle through the windshield. Conversely when the transmission is in RUN mode, i.e. drive, reverse, or neutral, the sunshield is automatically retracted to provide unobstructed views for the driver. When fabricated from a suitably tough material and the electrical control circuitry configured to permit a secure locked condition, the deployed sunshield can also offer a deterrent to unauthorized operation of the vehicle.
