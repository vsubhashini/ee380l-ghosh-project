An object of the present invention is to provide a solar cell module panel which is mounted on a roof of a building and united with roof rafters at low cost, whose installation and maintenance can be easily done, and which has long term reliability, especially with respect to protection of the solar cell modules. The solar cell modules of the solar cell module panel are mounted and fixed on the roof rafters, wherein at least one side edge portion of each solar cell module is held and fixed between the roof rafter and a solar cell module fastener member fixed to the roof rafter.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar cell module panel comprising: a substrate; a plurality of solar cell modules formed on said substrate; connecting members for electrically connecting said solar cell modules with each other; and fastener members for mounting said solar cell modules to a roof structure, wherein said connecting members are contained in said fastener members, and edge portions of said solar cell modules are held between said substrate and said fastener members which are fixed thereto. 2. A solar cell module panel according to claim 1, wherein a cross-sectional form of said substrate has flat portions and rising portions, and said fastener members are fixed to said rising portions. 3. A solar cell module panel according to claim 2, wherein said solar cell modules are flexible and are fixed to both said flat portions and said rising portions of said substrate. 4. A solar cell module panel according to claim 1, wherein water proof sealing members are provided between said solar cell module fastener members and said solar cell modules. 5. A solar cell module panel according to claim 1, including magnets for assisting fixation of said solar cell modules to said roof structure. 6. A solar cell module panel according to claim 1, wherein said solar cell modules are adhered to said substrate, by means including double-sided pressure sensitive adhesive coated tape.
