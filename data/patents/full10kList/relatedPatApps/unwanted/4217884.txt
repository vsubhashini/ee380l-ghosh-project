A solar energy utilization system employing a glazed, insulated, collector box that houses a plurality of swingably mounted, conduit type, energy absorber assemblies; together with associated, arcuately shaped booster mirrors for collecting solar rays and reflecting them toward the absorber assemblies; and in which each absorber assembly includes an absorber tube provided with surrounding, overlapping, cylindrical baffles that may be said to function like iris diaphragms to control an aperture which receives the reflected rays.
Claims I claim: 1. In a method of utilizing solar energy in which the sun's rays are received on an elongated reflecting surface located transversely of the path of daily movement of the sun across the sky, and said rays are reflected from said surface to direct rays through a variable aperture in a housing surrounding a conduit type absorber that is substantially parallel with said reflecting surface and to concentrate said rays as a linear image along said absorber; the improvement which comprises maintaining and continuing said directing and concentrating actions during selected daylight hours by swinging said housing and absorber from a starting position at one side of said reflecting surface toward the other side thereof through said selected hours to track the movement of said linear image during said hours, and adjusting said aperture to accommodate the changing insolation angles and linear image width resulting from said movement of the sun during said selected daylight hours. 2. A method as defined in claim 1, in which said adjusting step involves positioning said aperture to accommodate changes in the angles, and varying the size of said aperture to accommodate changes in said insolation said linear image width. 3. A method as claimed in claim 2, in which said swinging movement of said housing and absorber is utilized to position and vary the size of said aperture. 4. A method as defined in claim 3, in which said rays are directed through an aperture in a housing for said conduit type absorber that is formed by a pair of slotted cylinders mounted concentrically of said absorber for rotation relative thereto, said aperture is adjusted by rotating one of said cylinders to reduce the size of said aperture during forenoon hours and by rotating the other of said cylinders to increase the size of said aperture during afternoon hours, and said housing and said absorber are returned to their starting position after said selected daylight hours. 5. A method as defined in claim 1, in which a gaseous fluid is directed through said absorber to receive heat therefrom, and a liquid is introduced into said absorber in the path of said gaseous fluid. 6. In an apparatus for utilizing solar energy; a plurality of absorber assemblies each comprising a black absorber tube for receiving and absorbing heat from rays of the sun, and baffle means comprising a pair of slotted, overlapping coaxially mounted cylinders mounted concentrically of said tube for bodily movement therewith and for rotary movement about the axis of the tube to form a variable width aperture through which said rays reach said tube; means for moving said cylinders relative to one another and to said absorber tube to control the size and position of said aperture; an arcuately shaped elongated booster mirror having a focal plane and focal line, said focal line lying substantially parallel with the absorber tube of each of said assemblies, said mirror collecting rays of the sun reflecting and concentrating them toward and through said aperture and concentrating linear images thereof on said tube; means mounting said plurality of absorber assemblies for swinging movement in arcuate paths in a plane substantially perpendicular to the focal line of the reflector; means for swinging said assemblies in one direction within said arcuate paths in timed relation to the movement of the sun; a glazed and insulated box within which said swingable absorber assemblies and said mirrors are mounted in angular relation to the daily movement of the sun across the sky; and means for flowing a fluid through said black absorber tubes. 7. Apparatus as defined in claim 6, in which said means for moving said concentrically mounted slotted cylinders of said pair includes means actuated by swinging movement of said assemblies for rotating one of said cylinders relative to the other and to said tube during forenoon hours and for rotating the other of said cylinders relative to the first named cylinder and to said tube during afternoon hours.
