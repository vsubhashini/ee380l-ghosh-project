The standalone unit (110) of claim 1 wherein the energy storage unit (115) is configured to store energy in response to an energy storage request. 6. The standalone unit (110) of claim 1 wherein the standalone unit (110) is configured to release energy, in particular from the energy storage unit (115) and/or from the power generation unit (113), in response to an energy withdrawal request submitted to the standalone power grid (100). 7. The standalone unit (110) of claim 1 wherein the standalone unit (110) is configured to receive from the standalone power grid (100) an identification information that identifies the second standalone unit (120, 130), and the interface unit (116) is configured to communicate with the identified second standalone unit (120, 130). 8. The standalone unit (110) of claim 1 wherein the standalone unit (110) is configured to send an identification information request to the standalone power grid (100). 9. A standalone power grid (100), comprising the standalone unit (110) of claim 1 and an administrative unit (140) for communicating an energy withdrawal request and/or energy storage request with the standalone unit (100). 10. The standalone power grid (100) of claim 9, further comprising a second standalone unit (120, 130), said second standalone unit (120, 130) comprising a power generation unit (123, 323), in particular a photovoltaic unit, for generating power from renewable resources, an energy storage unit (125, 135) for storing energy, a load connection unit for connecting the second standalone unit (120, 130) to a load unit (121, 131) for the consumption of power, a grid unit (124, 134), in particular an inverter unit, for connecting the second standalone unit (120, 130) to a power grid, for drawing energy from the power grid and for feeding energy into the power grid, and an interface unit (126, 136) for communicating an energy withdrawal request and/or an energy storage request with the standalone unit (110). 11. A method for controlling the standalone power grid (100) of claim 10, comprising the step of communicating the energy withdrawal request and/or energy storage request between the standalone unit (100) and the second standalone unit (120, 130). 12. The method of claim 11, comprising the step of sending an energy withdrawal request and/or energy storage request from the administrative unit (140) to the standalone unit (110). 13. The method of claim 11 wherein the communication step involves receiving the energy withdrawal request from the second standalone unit (120, 130) to the standalone unit (110) to draw energy from the standalone unit (110), sending the energy withdrawal request from the standalone unit (110) to the second standalone unit (120, 130) to draw energy from the second standalone unit (120, 130), receiving the energy storage request from the second standalone unit (120, 130) to the standalone unit (110) to store energy in the standalone unit (110), sending the energy storage request from the standalone unit (110) to the second standalone unit (120, 130) to store energy in the second standalone unit (120, 130), and/or forwarding the energy withdrawal request and/or the energy storage request from the standalone unit (110) to the second standalone unit (120, 130). 14.
