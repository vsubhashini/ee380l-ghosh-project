According to the invention a metal oxide coating is plated onto a metal substrate at the cathode from an acid solution which contains an oxidizing agent. The process is particularly useful for producing solar panels. Conventional plating at the cathode avoids the presence of oxidizing agents. Coatings made in accordance with the invention are stable both at high temperatures and while under the influence of high photon flux in the visible range.
Claims I claim: 1. In a method of coating a substrate with a black metal oxide film from an electroplating solution containing about 44 ounces per gallon (a salt of a metal selected from the group consisting essentially) of cobalt sulfate, about 6 ounces per gallon of cobalt chloride, and about 5 ounces per gallon of boric acid having PH in the range between about 1.0 and about 6.0 at a temperature of about 115.degree. F. (, nickel, chromium, and manganese) to form a solar collector that is highly absorbing, the improvement comprising adding an oxidizing agent to said plating solution, mounting said substrate in said solution to form a cathode, and electrodepositing cobalt (said metal) from said solution onto said substrate at said cathode by passing a current of about 40 amps per square foot of substrate therethrough while simultaneously oxidizing the same. 2. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the oxidizing agent is H.sub.2 O.sub.2. 3. A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein 10 ml/liter of 30 percent H.sub.2 O.sub.2 is added to the electroplating solution. 4. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the electroplating solution has a PH of about 3.5.
