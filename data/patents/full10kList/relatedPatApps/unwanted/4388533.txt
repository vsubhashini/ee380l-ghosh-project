The power generating system of claim 3 wherein said mounting means movably mounts said first and second mirror assemblies for movement around said annular enclosure about a circular path concentric of said enclosure with said first mirror assembly and said second mirror assembly maintained on diametrically opposed sides of said enclosure, and further including first drive means for selectively moving said first and second mirror assemblies around said circular path, first sensing means for determining the direction of the sun with respect to said first mirror assembly, and first tracking control means operatively connected to said first drive means and said first sensing means to cause said first drive means to move said first and second mirror assemblies around said circular path to maintain said first mirror assembly directly facing the sun to reflect the sunlight onto said second mirror assembly. 7. The power generating system of claim 6 wherein said first mirror assembly includes a plurality of flat mirrors pivoted about horizontally oriented parallel axes and further including second drive means for simultaneously pivoting said flat mirrors about said horizontal axes so that said flat mirrors have equal angles of inclination as they are pivoted, second sensing means for determining the angle of inclination of the sun and second tracking control means operatively connected to said second drive means and said second sensing means to pivot said flat mirrors about said horizontal axes to maintain the angle of inclination of said flat mirrors such that the sunlight imposed on said flat mirrors is reflected horizontally to said second mirror assembly. 8. The power generating system of claim 4 further including monitoring means for monitoring the electrical power output from said electrical power generating means and the external electrical power demand load, said monitoring means connected to said fuel control means to cause said fuel control means to connect said gas generating means to the electrical output of said electrical power generating means and to cause said fuel distribution means to transfer the hydrogen gas from said gas generating means to said gas storage means when the electrical power output from said electrical power generating means exceeds the external power demand load; and to cause said fuel control means to disconnect said gas generating means from the electrical power output of said electrical power generating means and to cause said fuel distribution to supply hydrogen gas from said fuel storage means to said burner means when the external power demand load exceeds the electrical power output of said electrical power generating means.
