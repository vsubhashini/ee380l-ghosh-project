A solar power system including a thermal-storage tank installed in the ridge of the roof of a building, and a plurality of solar collector units covered over the roof and outside wall of the building and connected to the thermal-storage tank, wherein each solar collector unit comprises a transparent cover plate with photovoltaic cells for converting the radiant energy of sunlight into electric power, a rear mounting rail, a front mounting frame for engagement with the rear mounting rail of another solar collector unit, a heat-absorber plate having a collector tube connected to the thermal-storage tank, and a lateral mounting frame for connection to another solar collector unit over its heat-absorber plate by screws.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar power system comprising a plurality of solar collector units connected one another and covered over the roof frame of a building, and a thermal-storage tank connected to said solar collector units to collect heat energy, wherein each solar collector unit comprises a heat-insulative base frame, a transparent, channel-like lateral mounting frame, a heat-absorber plate, a transparent protective cover plate, and a channel-like front mounting frame, said heat-insulative base frame comprising a top receiving chamber having two opposite side grooves bilaterally disposed on the inside, a top convection chamber disposed at one side by said top receiving chamber and having two opposite side grooves bilaterally disposed on the inside, a series of screw holes inside said top receiving chamber above one side groove, an outer mounting groove at one lateral side thereof adjacent to said top receiving chamber, a plurality of front pin holes on a front side thereof, and a top mounting rail raised from a rear side thereof, said channel-like lateral mounting frame having one lateral side fitted into said outer mounting groove on said base frame and an opposite lateral side made with a series of mounting holes for connection to the screw holes on another solar collector unit, said transparent protective cover plate being inserted into the side grooves on said top receiving chamber, comprising an insulative bottom layer, an electric energy output interface board, and a plurality of photovoltaic cells mounted above said insulative bottom layer and connected to said electric energy output interface board, said heat-absorber plate being inserted into the side grooves on said top convection chamber and having a collector tube connected to said thermal-storage tank, said channel-like front mounting frame having a plurality of upright pins at a back side thereof respectively fitted into said front pin holes on said base frame and a bottom mounting groove for engagement with the top mounting rail of another solar collector unit. 2. The solar power system of claim 1 wherein said transparent protective cover plate is made from toughened glass covered with an insulative bottom layer to hold a plurality of photovoltaic cells on the inside. 3. The solar power system of claim 1 wherein said transparent protective cover plate is made from polycarbonate covered with an insulative bottom layer to hold a plurality of photovoltaic cells on the inside. 4. The solar power system of claim 1 wherein said base frame is externally covered with an insulative layer made from foamed plastics. 5. The solar power system of claim 1 wherein said thermal-storage tank is installed in the ridge of the roof frame of the building.
