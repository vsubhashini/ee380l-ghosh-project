A portable lamp unit having adhesive strips for mounting upon the interior surface of a hatch back automobile window. A mercury switch permits the lamp to be lit only when the hatch back lid is open. A solar cell aligned with and receiving sunlight through the window charges the batteries. The lamp housing is swingably mounted and a detent enables the lamp to be retained in one of a number of different orientations to direct light to a selected region, and may be releasably locked in any one of a variety of positions to compensate for various open hatch angles to direct the focussed light rays upon the desired region of the storage space. A switch selectively opens the power loop to prevent unnecessary drainage of the batteries when the hatch back is opened for a long periods of time. A light transmissive adhesive may be utilized to mount the unit upon a window. Alternatively, a frame may be mounted to the window to snap fittingly releasably retain the lamp unit in position upon the hatch back window.

The lamp unit of claim 2 wherein said combination detent and pivot member is provided with a teat projecting in a direction toward said lamp housing; the adjacent surface of said lamp housing having a plurality of recesses arranged at spaced intervals along an imaginary curved line for snap fittingly receiving said teat to thereby form a detent mechanism for locking said swingably mounted lamp housing in any one of a variety of different angular positions selectable by the operator. 4. A lamp unit comprising a hollow housing; a battery compartment in said housing containing a portable battery source; a lamp compartment in said housing and orientation sensitive switch means for selectively electrically coupling said lamp to said battery source when said housing is in a first orientation and for electrically decoupling said lamp from said battery source when said housing is in a second orientation; means for substantially permanently affixing said housing to a normally movable lid member such as a chest, truck or hatchback lid adapted as a closure for a storage region; said housing being affixed to the interior surface of said lid whereby said orientation sensitive switch is in the open position when the lid is in its closed position and whereby the orientation sensitive switch is in the closed position when said lid is in its open position; said lamp housing being provided with a combined front cover and lens member in which the center portions said combined member comprises an integral transparent lens; the opposite walls of said lens housing being respectively provided with a slot and a square-shaped notch; said combined front cover and lens member being provided with a first projection along one edge of the periphery of said combined member of insertion into said slot and a second projection arranged on an opposite parallel edge of said combined member of insertion into said notch; said combined member being provided with a pair of teats each arranged on opposite sides of said second projection and cooperating with a pair of openings provided in the wall of said lamp housing for snap-fittingly receiving said teats to releasably lock the combined member into the operative position within the lens housing. 5. A lamp unit comprising a hollow housing; a battery compartment in said housing containing a portable battery source; a lamp compartment in said housing and orientation sensitive switch means for selectively electrically coupling said lamp to said battery source when said housing is in a first orientation and for electrically decoupling said lamp from said battery source when said housing is in a second orientation; means for substantially permanently affixing said housing to a normally movable lid member such as a chest, truck or hatchback lid adapted as a closure for a storage region; said housing being affixed to the interior surface of said lid whereby said orientation sensitive switch is in the open position when the lid is in its closed position and whereby the orientation sensitive switch is in the closed position when said lid is in its open position; said affixing means comprising pressure sensitive mounting means comprised of a double-sided pressure sensitive sheet having one surface adhered to the hollow housing and covering said solar cell lens and having the other surface adapted for permanent affixation to the light transmissive member or window of a swingable lid; said double sided pressure sensitive sheet being light transparent to permit light passing through said window to pass through said double-sided pressure sensitive adhesive sheet and through said solar cell lens to energize said solar cell; a partially transparent reflective surface being provided on the side of said single-sided pressure sensitive adhesive sheet engaging said window to act as a safety reflector for reflecting light from the head lamps of oncoming cars impinging upon said reflective surface. 6. A lamp unit comprising a hollow housing; a battery compartment in said housing containing a portable battery source; a lamp compartment in said housing and orientation sensitive switch means for selectively electrically coupling said lamp to said battery source when said housing is in a first orientation and for electrically decoupling said lamp from said battery source when said housing is in a second orientation; means for substantially permanently affixing said housing to a normally movable lid member such as a chest, truck or hatchback lid adapted as a closure for a storage region; said housing being affixed to the interior surface of said lid whereby said orientation sensitive switch is in the open position when the lid is in its closed position and whereby the orientation sensitive switch is in the closed position when said lid is in its open position; said mounting means comprising a mounting frame adhered to said lid and having a plurality of pairs of resilient embracing arms each having inwardly directly teats near their upper ends; said lamp unit hollow housing being provided with shallow recesses on opposite side walls of said housing for receiving and seating an associated one of the teats of said resilient embracing arms for releasably holding said lamp unit; said holding frame being provided with an opening comparable in size with the solar cell lens provided on said hollow housing unit to facilitate the passage of light through said opening and said lens for activating said solar cell. 7.
