This solar powered goose repellant (GRS) Unit will harmlessly keep away Canada geese, ducks, crows, gulls, vultures, cormorants, egrets, and herons. It will do this by sensing the animals via PIR sensor, recharging via solar cells and scare the geese away via 532 nm DPSS Green Laser that will disperse and pivot side to side throw its holographic diffraction grating lens.
Claims 1. A solar powered goose repellant automated laser system, comprising: (a) a solar cell for receiving sunlight and for generating charging current therefrom; (b) a rechargeable power source coupled to said solar cell for receiving said current and charging as a result thereof; (c) a contactless goose sensing mechanism means for monitoring, without requiring contact between said contactless pyroelectric passive infrared (PIR) sensor means and an object, in an area near said sensor means, the movement into the area of the object including geese and other animals or a source of radiation, and for providing a signal indicative thereof; (d) an amplifier coupled to said contactless sensor means and to said rechargeable power source for amplifying said signal; (e) a control circuit coupled to said amplifier, to said rechargeable power source, and to a Class-IIIb OEM, <50 mW green laser that disperses throw a holographic diffraction grating, including switching means for causing said rechargeable power source to turn on said 3M laser with a Wavelength of 532 nm source when an amplified signal is received from said amplifier, and timing means for causing said switching means to disconnect from said rechargeable power source after a desired length of time has transpired.
