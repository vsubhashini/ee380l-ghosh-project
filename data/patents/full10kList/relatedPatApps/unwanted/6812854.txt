An emergency vehicle alert system coupled with an interior rearview mirror assembly attached to the windshield or a header portion of a vehicle that will visually and audibly alert a driver of the presence of an emergency vehicle or railroad train in the proximity of the driver. A sound transducer having a probe engaged with the windshield receives acoustical warning signals from emergency vehicles and other vehicles, converts them into electrical audio frequency signals and sends them to an audio pre-amplifier which amplifies the signals and feeds them to a sound discriminator calibrated to evaluate and discriminate between signals that fit within parameters set for particular emergency sound frequencies. A piezo beeper alarm and an audio output amplifier and programmed voice warning unit are triggered upon detection of sounds that fit within the parameters. The piezo beeper alarm emits a continuous audible high-pitched tone, and the audio output amplifier and programmed voice warning unit plays a digital voice announcement via a speaker, and light emitting diodes become illuminated at the same time the audible high-pitched tone and voice announcement are activated. The circuitry is powered by one or more DC batteries and may be recharged by solar cells.
