A community-scale water condensing system which reclaims and stores double-filtered potable water from the air utilizing at least one condenser unit including polyethylene pipe suspended over a collection tank and shaken by a self-contained power source upon activation of a moisture sensor to release water into the collection tank. Water flows from the collection tank into a storage tank through a ball valve and a water storage filter. At least one dispensing unit operationally communicates with the storage tank, each dispensing unit including at least one feeder line with an output valve that can be accessed by an individual through a water tap or other outlet mechanism. A water usage filter disposed between each output valve and each water tap removes debris from the water prior to dispensing the water from the water tap. An auxiliary dispensing unit selectively dispenses additional water during maintenance or shutdown of the other dispensing units.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A water condensing system comprising: a portable collection unit comprising: a coolant compressor, a solar array comprising a plurality of solar cells, the solar array in attached to the collection unit, the solar array in selectively, alternatively operational communication with the battery, a rechargeable battery charged by the solar array, the rechargeable battery in selectively, alternatively operational communication the coolant compressor, a backup generator in operational communication with the collection unit, the backup generator selectively, alternatively providing power to the battery a switch in operational communication with the backup generator and the solar array, the switch selectively, alternatively activating the backup generator and the solar array, a condenser unit in operational communication with the coolant compressor, a volume of coolant located within the coolant compressor and the condenser unit, a thermal switch in operational communication with the coolant compressor, wherein the thermal switch controls the operation of the condenser unit, further wherein the thermal switch deactivates operation of the coolant compressor upon detection of a pre-determined temperature of the condenser unit temperature, a length of polyethylene pipe disposed within the condenser unit, wherein the pipe is cooled by the coolant compressor, wherein an amount of water condenses on the polyethylene pipe, a moisture sensor in operational communication with the condenser unit, a self-contained power source in operational communication with the moisture sensor and with the condenser unit, wherein the self-contained power source shakes the polyethylene pipe disposed within the condenser unit upon the detection of water by the moisture sensor, a water collection tank receives and collects the water shaken from the polyethylene pipe, a storage unit in operational communication with the collection unit, the storage unit comprising: a water storage tank removably receiving water from the water collection tank storing the water, at least one outflow line attached to the water collection tank, the outflow line also being connected to the water storage tank, at least one ball valve, where one ball valve is located on each outflow line, a water storage filter disposed along each outflow line between each ball valve and the water storage tank, a level meter in operational communication with the water storage tank, the level meter monitoring the level of water within the water storage tank, a level meter attached to the water storage tank, wherein the level meter is in selective, alternative operational communication with the solar array and the backup generator, a dispensing unit in operational communication with the storage unit comprising: at least one feeder line attached to the water storage tank, a water output valve in operational communication with each feeder line, a usage valve in operational communication with each water output valve, wherein one water usage valve is attached to each feeder line, a water tap operationally disposed at a terminus of each feeder line. 2. A water condensing system according to claim 1 further comprising: a water usage filter operationally disposed between each water output valve and each water tap, wherein the water usage filter removes debris from the water prior to dispensing of the water from the water tap. 3. A water condensing system according to claim 2 further comprising: an auxiliary dispensing unit in operational communication with the water storage tank, the auxiliary dispensing unit comprising: a secondary feeder line; an auxiliary output valve disposed along the secondary feeder line; a secondary water usage filter disposed between the auxiliary output valve and the water tap, wherein the secondary water usage filter removes debris from the water prior to dispensing of the water from the water tap, wherein the auxiliary dispensing unit selectively dispenses water in addition to water dispensed by the dispensing units. 4. A water condensing system according to claim 3 wherein each water output valve further comprises a handle.
