A process for producing hydrocarbons through a heater wellbore positioned in a hydrocarbon containing formation. The in situ treatment process may include providing heat from one or more heaters to at least a portion of the formation. The heat may be allowed, in some embodiments, to transfer from one or more heaters to a selected section of the formation. Heat that is allowed to transfer to the selected section may pyrolyze at least some of the hydrocarbons within the selected section. The process may include, in some embodiments, selectively limiting a temperature proximate a selected portion of a heater wellbore to inhibit coke formation at or near the selected portion. In some embodiments fluids may be produced at certain locations of a heater wellbore such that coke formation is inhibited.
