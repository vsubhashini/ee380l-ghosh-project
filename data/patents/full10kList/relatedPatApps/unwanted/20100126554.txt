A solar panel assembly with a first group of spaced-apart solar energy collector modules and a second group of spaced-apart solar energy collector modules. The first and second groups lie in respective parallel planes, which define an air gap therebetween, and are staggered with respect to each other. The staggering of the groups allows for light not harvested by the first row to be harvested by the second row and provides a low dead-space characteristic for the solar panel assembly. The gap between the planes and the space between individual solar energy collector modules of a same group allow for improved heat dissipation in the modules and for the solar panel assembly to offer low resistance to wind.
