A circuit for operation with solar panels exhibiting constant current and variable voltage characteristics. The power output of the panels is maximized by the circuit through the use of a step-down form of regulator which functions to monitor the peak voltage level of the panel and regulate with a switching type regulator in accordance therewith. Thus, peak voltage levels are maintained while current output to the load driven by the panels is enhanced. When employed for battery charging, the circuit includes a threshold selection network which identifies the nominal voltage rating of the battery under charge and provides appropriate adjustments to carry out a pulse charging technique. For start-up conditions wherein battery voltages may be below levels requisite to evaluate nominal rated voltages, a higher level charging voltage is applied for a predetermined short interval until adequate threshold is achieved to make appropriate determinations of rated voltage values. In one embodiment of the current boosting circuit, the gate capacitance of a field effect transistor type regulator switching component is taken advantage of to simplify circuit structure.
