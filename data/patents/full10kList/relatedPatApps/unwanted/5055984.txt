A solar rechargeable light has a lamp for illuminating a selected area such as the ground or a wall. A base is adapted to support the lamp in a fixed position to illuminate the selected area. An electrical storage device and power supply is electrically coupled to the lamp. A solar panel is electrically coupled to the electrical storage device for charging the storage device when the solar panel is exposed to light, wherein current from the storage device energizes the lamp, and wherein the solar panel is moveable relative to the base so that the orientation of the solar panel is substantially independent of an orientation of the lamp relative to the selected area.
Claims We claim: 1. A solar rechargable light assembly comprising: a substantially planar base; a lamp mounted in the planar base in a fixed position for illuminating a selected area such as the ground or a wall in a direction away from the base; a mount releasably fixed on the base for mounting the light assembly to a support such as the ground or a wall; an electrical storage device and power supply for supplying electric current to the lamp; a cover mounted to a side of the base opposite the lamp and rotatable relative to the base through an angle less than 360.degree.; and a solar panel fixed to the cover at an angle slanted relative to the planar base to face away form the base and electrically coupled to the electrical storage device for charging the storage device when the solar panel is exposed to light, and wherein current from the storage device illuminates the lamp.
