The solar collector roofing shingle as claimed in claim 3, wherein said first projection is F-shaped in lateral cross-section facing in the direction of the lower edge of said planar sheet portion, upper and lower right angle ledges from said elongated first groove and the lower edge of said shingle planar sheet portion comprises a reverse bent U-shaped portion defining an elongated second groove which receives the upper flange of the F-shaped first projection of the adjacent shingle to form said interlocking means between respective shingles. 5. The solar collector roofing shingle as claimed in claim 4, wherein said spring clip means comprises a metal spring strip of modified U-shape in cross-section which engages said reverse bent portion of the lower edge of said shingle planar sheet portion and having a leg frictionally engaging the upper surface of the lower edge of said light transmissive plate to press the lower edge of said light transmissive plate against the lower edge of said shingle planar sheet portion and to maintain the upper edge of said light transmissive plate within said groove of said F-shaped first projection and to form a cavity between said light transmissive plate and said planar sheet portion which is triangular in cross-sectional configuration. 6. The solar collector roofing shingle as claimed in claim 5, wherein the upper edge of said shingle planar sheet portion terminates in a right angle upwardly directed second projection such that mounting clamps fixed to the upper edge of said rafters terminating in a U-shape may receive said second projection to fixedly mount the upper edge of said planar sheet portion in contact with said rafters, and wherein said fluid conduit means lies intermediate of said upper and lower edges of said planar sheet portion to incline said planar sheet portion outwardly of said rafters in a direction toward said lower edge. 7. The solar collector roofing shingle as claimed in claim 1, wherein the upper edge of said planar sheet portion of each shingle comprises an integral first projection which projects outwardly therefrom and includes in a protruding ridge on its face, facing away from the lower edge of said shingle, said ridge lying inwardly of the edge of said integral first projection, and the lower edge of said planar sheet portion comprises a pair of spaced inwardly directed projections defining a narrow diverging channel, and wherein the upper of the two inwardly directed projections at said lower edge terminates in a rounded protruding lip; whereby, a lower edge of one shingle may be tilted outwardly of the inclined building roof rafters to permit the protruding ridge of said first projection of another shingle to pass beyond the rounded lip and to be locked thereby upon pivoting of said one shingle towards said inclined roof rafters. 8. The solar collector roofing shingle as claimed in claim 7, further comprising a light transmissive plate of rectangular configuration and of a size generally equal to that of the shingle, said first projection includes an offset defining a shelf for one end of said light transmissive plate, the other end of said light transmissive plate rests on the upper surface of said shingle elongated planar sheet portion and spring clip means carried by the lower edge of the planar sheet portion of said shingle and frictionally gripping the inwardly directed projection most remote from said first projection frictionally presses the lower edge of said light transmissive plate against the lower edge of said shingle and said spring clip means further comprises means for resiliently pressing the upper edge of said light transmissive plate against the shelf of the succeeding lower shingle. 9. In combination, an improved roof structure for a building or the like, said building comprising: vertical sidewalls and a plurality of laterally spaced, upwardly inclined rafters mounted to said sidewalls, a plurality of extruded metal solar collector roofing shingles mounted in overlapping edge, parallel array fashion across said laterally spaced inclined rafters, each shingle comprising an elongated planar sheet portion having upper and lower surfaces and laterally opposed upper and lower edges, said upper surface facing away from the building interior, said shingles each including an integrally extruded fluid conducting tube extending longitudinally of said planar sheet portion and projecting from the lower surface thereof, and integrally extruded interlock means incorporated within the opposed lateral edges of said planar sheet portions to mechanically interlock the overlapping edges of respective sheet portions of adjacent shingles. 10. The combination as claimed in claim 9, further comprising light transmissive plates of rectangular configuration and of a size generally equal to that of said shingles, and means for mounting a light transmissive plate to the upper surface of each of said shingles and spaced therefrom at least along one of said laterally opposed edges. 11. The combination as claimed in claim 10, wherein said interlocking means comprises an integral projection projecting outwardly from the upper edge of each shingle and defining a ledge facing towards the lower edge of that shingle and a reversely bent portion of the lower edge of the shingle directed downwardly of the bottom thereof and defining an elongated groove for receiving a ledge of the adjacent shingle. 12. The combination as claimed in claim 9, wherein said interlocking means comprises an integral projection projecting outwardly from the upper edge of each shingle and including a protruding ridge on the face of said projection facing away from the lower edge of said shingle and first and second inwardly directed projections projecting from the lower edge of each shingle and defining a narrow diverging channel, and wherein the inwardly directed projection at the lower edge of said shingle on the upper side of said channel terminates in a rounded protruding lip with said ridge and said protruding lip being positioned such that upon tilting of the shingle away from the rafters of said building, the protruding ridge is positioned within said channel internally of said projection protrusion lip; thereby locking respectively the lower edges of given shingles to the upper edges of succeeding shingles. 13. The combination as claimed in claim 12, wherein said first integral projection at the upper edge of each shingle is offset to form a shelf, light transmissive plates of rectangular configuration of a size generally equal to that of the shingle are provided for each shingle and the upper edge of said light transmissive plate is positioned on said shelf and the lower edge of said light transmissive plate rests against the lower edge of the outer surface of the outer edge of each shingle, and said combination further comprises spring clip means mounted to the lower projection at said shingle lower edge and resiliently clamping the lower edge of said light transmissive plate to said shingle and resiliently pressing the upper edge of the succeeding light transmissive plate to the shelf of the corresponding succeeding shingle. 14. The combination as claimed in claim 12, wherein said shingles each comprise an inwardly directed L-shaped projection at the upper edge thereof, and a metal mounting plate is fixed to the surface of said rafter and includes a slot for receiving said L-shaped projection of said shingle, and a Teflon insert is carried within said metal clip slot between said L-shaped projection of said shingle and said clip to permit said shingle to thermally expand and compress without generation of noise, and thermally isolate said shingles from said building structure rafters. 15. The combination as claimed in claim 12, further comprising at least one fiberglass reinforced plastic glazing sheet overlying a plurality of said collector shingles and wherein said spring clip means further comprises means for coupling said glazing sheet overlying to said shingle, but spaced therefrom. 16. The combination as claimed in claim 15, wherein said glazing sheets are plural in number and overlap at their edges and said spring clip means includes means for frictionally gripping the overlapped edges of said plural glazing sheets at said overlap.
