A configurable fence system has a solar panel on a mounting surface that can tilt in accordance with a closed loop control system. A solar system for a fence includes a support structure mounted along the top length of the fence, a first mounting surface extending from the supporting structure, a first solar panel on the first mounting surface, a second mounting surface extending from the supporting structure, a second solar panel on the second mounting surface, and a pair of adjustable arms for tilting the first and second mounting surfaces with respect to the fence for sunlight exposure. The pair of arms can be also coupled to a motor and a solar detection and feedback control system for motorized adjustment.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A configurable fence system having a solar panel, comprising: a pair of fence posts, connected by two parallel horizontal fence stringers forming a rectangular fence framework; a pair of longitudinal cross section L-shaped retainer angles, with a parallel separation to be defined by the thickness of a panel to be inserted, mounted on each of the inner surfaces of the rectangular fence framework in an orientation of either face-to-face or back-to-back to form an enclosed slotted rectangular fence framework; a support structure extending from or secured to the rectangular fence framework including a mounting surface for a solar panel; a solar panel secured to the mounting surface; and a closed loop control system including a motor coupled to the mounting surface to tilt the mounting surface with respect to the fence to maximize the amount of sunlight captured. 2. A solar system adapted to mount on a fence, comprising: a support structure mounted along the top length of the fence; a first mounting surface extending from or secured to the supporting structure; a first solar panel on the first mounting surface; a second mounting surface extending from or secured to the supporting structure; a second solar panel on the second mounting surface; and means for tilting the first mounting surface and the second mounting surface with respect to the fence for optimal exposure to the sunlight, wherein the means for tilting is coupled to a motor and a solar detection and feedback control system for motorized adjustment. 3. A solar system adapted to mount on a fence, comprising: a plurality of extensions mounted along the top length of the fence; a first mounting surface extending from or secured to the plurality of extensions; a first solar panel on the first mounting surface; a second mounting surface extending from or secured to the plurality of extensions; a pair of arms extending from each of the plurality of extensions to the first and second mounting surfaces; and a second solar panel on the second mounting surface, wherein the pair of arms are adjustable for tilting the first mounting surface and the second mounting surface with respect to the fence for optimal exposure to the sunlight and wherein the pair of arms are coupled to a motor and a solar detection and feedback control system for motorized adjustment.
