On the basis of state change information acquired by one of sensor nodes forming a sensor network, an instruction indicative of emitting a signal is issued to another node to acquire a photographed image from a camera. An image processing device identifies the ID and actual position of the node by issuing the signal issuance instruction to the node and detecting a signal obtained from the node from the photographed image. On the basis of personal information stored in a database, the image processing device detects a not-allowed action.
