A solar powered fluid heating system for providing a user with a cost and energy saving advantage when heating fluids includes a solar dish which includes a mirrored concave surface. A power head assembly coupled to the solar dish by a support pole extending outwardly from the solar dish. A fluid line extending through the support pole. The fluid line is coiled at a focal point of the mirrored surface of the solar dish whereby solar rays are directed by the solar dish onto the coiled fluid line for heating fluid passing through the coiled fluid line.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar powered fluid heating system comprising: a solar dish having a mirrored concave surface; a power head assembly coupled to said solar dish by a support pole extending outwardly from said solar dish; a fluid line extending through a lumen of said support pole, an outer wall of said support pole inhibiting damage to said fluid line extending through said support pole, said fluid line being coiled at a focal point of said mirrored surface of said solar dish whereby solar rays are directed by said solar dish onto said coiled fluid line for heating fluid passing through said coiled fluid line; said power head assembly being positioned proximate a focal point of said mirrored concave surface for maximizing efficiency of said fluid heating system; said power head assembly including a dish member, said dish member having a reflective concave surface facing said mirrored concave surface of said solar dish for directing solar rays to said coiled fluid line for heating fluid passing through said coiled fluid line. 2. The solar powered fluid heating system of claim 1, further comprising: a base support member for supporting said solar dish; a dish adjustment assembly coupled between said solar dish and said base support member for adjustably coupling said solar dish to said base support member whereby said solar dish is adapted for positioning to face the sun. 3. The solar powered fluid heating system of claim 2, wherein said dish adjustment assembly comprises: a mounting bracket mounted to said solar dish; a connection member mounted to said solar dish and offset from said mounting bracket; a generally U-shaped adjustment bracket pivotally mounted to said mounting bracket; a first adjustment motor having an extendable adjustment arm, said first adjustment motor being coupled between said connection member and a distal end of said adjustment bracket such that extension of said adjustment arm pivots said solar dish relative to said adjustment bracket; a medial portion of a cross-member of said adjustment bracket being pivotally coupled to a base connection member extending from said base support member; and a second adjustment motor having an extendable adjustment arm, said second adjustment motor being coupled between said base support member and an end of said cross-member of said adjustment bracket such that extension of said adjustment arm of said second adjustment motor pivots said solar dish relative to said base connection member. 4. The solar powered fluid heating system of claim 3, further comprising: an electronic control assembly operationally coupled to said first adjustment motor and said second adjustment motor for facilitating positioning of said solar dish. 5. The solar powered fluid heating system of claim 4, further comprising: said power head assembly including a heat sensor, said heat sensor being operationally coupled to said electronic control assembly; a light sensor coupled to said solar dish and operationally coupled to said electronic control assembly for facilitating automatic positioning of said solar dish such that said electronic control assembly selectively activates said first and second adjustment motors whereby the solar dish is adapted to face the sun as the sun moves relative to the position of the solar dish to maximize the efficiency of the fluid heating system. 6. The solar powered fluid heating system of claim 4, further comprising: a solar collector panel coupled to a perimeter edge of said solar dish, said solar collector panel being operationally coupled to said electronic control assembly for providing power to said electronic control assembly. 7. The solar powered fluid heating system of claim 1, further comprising: said solar dish including a plurality of generally triangular fiberglass panels, each panel having a plurality of mirrors coupled to a face of said panel; and said solar dish including a central plate member, said central plate member having at least one drainage hole for permitting fluid to drain from said solar dish, said central plate further having a plurality of bolt holes for facilitating coupling of said panels to said central plate for forming said solar dish. 8. The solar powered fluid heating system of claim 7, further comprising: each of said mirrors being generally hexagonal in shape. 9. A solar powered fluid heating system comprising: a solar dish having a mirrored concave surface; a power head assembly coupled to said solar dish by a support pole extending outwardly from said solar dish; a fluid line extending through a lumen of said support pole, an outer wall of said support pole inhibiting damage to said fluid line extending through said support pole, said fluid line being coiled at a focal point of said mirrored surface of said solar dish whereby solar rays are directed by said solar dish onto said coiled fluid line for heating fluid passing through said coiled fluid line; a base support member for supporting said solar dish; a dish adjustment assembly coupled between said solar dish and said base support member for adjustably coupling said solar dish to said base support member whereby said solar dish is adapted for positioning to face the sun; wherein said dish adjustment assembly includes a mounting bracket mounted to said solar dish; a connection member mounted to said solar dish and offset from said mounting bracket; a generally U-shaped adjustment bracket pivotally mounted to said mounting bracket; a first adjustment motor having an extendable adjustment arm, said first adjustment motor being coupled between said connection member and a distal end of said adjustment bracket such that extension of said adjustment arm pivots said solar dish relative to said adjustment bracket; a medial portion of a cross-member of said adjustment bracket being pivotally coupled to a base connection member extending from said base support member; a second adjustment motor having an extendable adjustment arm, said second adjustment motor being coupled between said base support member and an end of said cross-member of said adjustment bracket such that extension of said adjustment arm of said second adjustment motor pivots said solar dish relative to said base connection member; said power head assembly being positioned proximate a focal point of said mirrored concave surface for maximizing efficiency of said fluid heating system; an electronic control assembly operationally coupled to said first adjustment motor and said second adjustment motor for facilitating positioning of said solar dish; said power head assembly including a heat sensor, said heat sensor being operationally coupled to said electronic control assembly; a light sensor coupled to said solar dish and operationally coupled to said electronic control assembly for facilitating automatic positioning of said solar dish such that said electronic control assembly selectively activates said first and second adjustment motors whereby the solar dish is adapted to face the sun as the sun moves relative to the position of the solar dish to maximize the efficiency of the fluid heating system; a solar collector panel coupled to a perimeter edge of said solar dish, said solar collector panel being operationally coupled to said electronic control assembly for providing power to said electronic control assembly; said power head assembly including a dish member, said dish member having a reflective concave surface facing said mirrored concave surface of said solar dish for directing solar rays to said coiled fluid line for heating fluid passing through said coiled fluid line; said solar dish including a plurality of generally triangular fiberglass panels, each panel having a plurality of generally hexagonal mirrors coupled to a face of said panel; and said central plate member having at least one drainage hole for permitting fluid to drain from said solar dish, said central plate further having a plurality of bolt holes for facilitating coupling of said panels to said central plate for forming said solar dish.
