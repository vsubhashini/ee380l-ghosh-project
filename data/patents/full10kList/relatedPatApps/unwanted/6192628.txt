The pet barrier of claim 1, wherein said open frame further comprises spaced apart elongate top and bottom members, and a spaced apart pair of elongate side members extending between said top and bottom members of said open frame. 3. The pet barrier of claim 2, wherein each of said members of said open frame comprises a pair of separate portions slidably mounted to one another, a first of said portions of each member of said open frame having an opening telescopically receiving therein an extent extending from a second of said portions of the respective member such that said second portions are telescopically extendable from the associated first portions. 4. The pet barrier of claim 3, wherein said first portions of said members each have an inwardly radiating annular flange around said opening of the respective first portion, wherein said extents of said second portions of said members each have an outwardly radiating annular stop disposed in the associated first portion of the respective member. 5. The pet barrier of claim 3, wherein said first portions of said members each have a spring disposed therein between said extent of the associated second portion and a wall disposed in the respective first portion to bias the associated second portion away from said opening of the respective first portion. 6. The pet barrier of claim 1, wherein said open frame has an elongate channel around an outer periphery of said open frame, said channel being adapted for receiving a portion of said window frame therein to hold said open frame in said open window of said vehicle. 7. The pet barrier of claim 1, wherein said open frame has an resiliently deformable outer coating. 8. A pet barrier system, comprising: a vehicle having a window frame defining an open window of the vehicle; a pet barrier, comprising: an open frame defining a central opening and comprising spaced apart elongate top and bottom members, and a spaced apart pair of elongate side members extending between said top and bottom members of said open frame, said open frame having interior and exterior faces; each of said members of said open frame being integrally coupled to adjacent members of said open frame; said open frame being adapted for positioning in an open window of a vehicle such that said open frame extends along a window frame of the window with said interior face of said open frame facing into the vehicle and said exterior face of said open frame extending away from the vehicle; said open frame being shaped to fit the shape of the window frame of the window; said open frame being generally trapezodial in shape with said top and bottom members extended substantially parallel to one another; said open frame being positioned in said open window of said vehicle such that said open frame extends along the window frame with the interior face of the open frame facing into the vehicle and the exterior face of the open frame extending away from the vehicle; said open frame having an elongate channel around an outer periphery of said open frame, said channel having an arcuate transverse cross section with an outwardly facing concavity; said channel receiving therein a portion of said window frame therein to hold said open frame in said open window of said vehicle; said open frame further comprising a plurality of elongate cross members extending between said side members of said open frame; said cross members of said open frame being extended substantially parallel to one another and to said top and bottom members of said open frame; said cross members of said open frame being spaced apart at substantially equal intervals between said top and bottom members of said open frame; wherein said interval is between about 1 inch and about 8 inches to prevent pets from passing through said open frame; each of said members of said open frame comprising a pair of separate portions slidably mounted to one another; a first of said portions of each member of said open frame having an opening telescopically receiving therein an extent extending from a second of said portions of the respective member such that said second portions are telescopically extendable from the associated first portions; said first portions of said members each having an inwardly radiating annular flange around said opening of the respective first portion; said extents of said second portions of said members each having an outwardly radiating annular stop disposed in the associated first portion of the respective member, said stop cooperating with said flange to prevent said extent from sliding completely out of said opening of said first portion; said first portions of said members each having a coiled compression spring disposed therein between said stop of said extent of the associated second portion and a wall disposed in the respective first portion to bias the associated second portion away from said opening of the respective first portion; said spring assembly being adapted for spreading said members of said open frame apart until said members jam against adjacent portions of the window frame of the window of the vehicle so that said open frame is held securely in place in the window; wherein said open frame has an resiliently deformable outer coating over said top, bottom, side and cross members to protect the window frame from scratches and other contact with said open frame; a fan for blowing air being pivotally coupled to said interior face of said open frame; a solar panel being pivotally coupled to said exterior face of said open frame such that said solar panel may be positioned in an orientation with respect to sun light for maximizing sun light striking said solar panel; and said solar panel comprising a plurality of photovoltaic cells electrically connected to said fan. 9. A pet barrier, comprising: an open frame defining a central opening and comprising spaced apart elongate top and bottom members, and a spaced apart pair of elongate side members extending between said top and bottom members of said open frame, said open frame having interior and exterior faces; said open frame having an elongate channel around an outer periphery of said open frame, said channel having an arcuate transverse cross section with an outwardly facing concavity; each of said members of said open frame comprising a pair of separate portions slidably mounted to one another; a first of said portions of each member of said open frame having an opening telescopically receiving therein an extent extending from a second of said portions of the respective member such that said second portions are telescopically extendable from the associated first portions; said first portions of said members each having an inwardly radiating annular flange around said opening of the respective first portion; said extents of said second portions of said members each having an outwardly radiating annular stop disposed in the associated first portion of the respective member; said first portions of said members each having a spring disposed therein between said stop of said extent of the associated second portion and a wall disposed in the respective first portion to bias the associated second portion away from said opening of the respective first portion; wherein said open frame has an resiliently deformable outer coating; a flexible screen substantially covering said central opening of said open frame, said screen having a plurality of apertures therethrough; said screen having an outer perimeter corresponding to the shape of said open frame such that said outer perimeter of said screen is extended along said top, bottom and side members said open frame adjacent said interior face of said open frame; said outer perimeter of said screen being coupled to said interior face of said open frame; a fan for blowing air; a mounting extent being extended from one of said side members of said open frame, said fan being coupled to said mounting extent, said mounting extent being extended substantially perpendicular from the associated side member of said open frame; a solar panel being pivotally coupled to said exterior face of said open frame such that said solar panel may be positioned in an orientation with respect to sun light for maximizing sun light striking said solar panel; and said solar panel comprising a plurality of photovoltaic cells electrically connected to said fan.
