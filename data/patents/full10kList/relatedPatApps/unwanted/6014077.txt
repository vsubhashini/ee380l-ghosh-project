An improved apparatus of claim 1 wherein the positional status switch comprises: a) a magnetic housing mounted on the moveable barrier, said magnetic housing further comprising an internal magnet; and b) a switch housing mounted on the entryway, said switch housing further comprising a switch, said switch responsive to said internal magnet when mounted in close proximity and in responsive range of said switch; whereby said magnetic element may open or close said switch, and thereby indicate the positional status of the moveable barrier. 3. An improved apparatus of claim 1 further comprising: a) a solar panel to receive and convert light to create a charging current; b) a step-down voltage regulator, said step-down voltage regulator connected to said control circuit and said voice synthesizer; c) a means for connecting said solar panel to a rechargeable power source to receive said charging current; and d) a means for connecting the rechargeable power source to said step-down voltage regulator and to said audio amplifier. 4. An improved apparatus of claim 1 wherein the control circuit is a microcontroller and the voice synthesis means is an integrated circuit. 5. An improved apparatus of claim 3 further comprising: a) a mast; b) an electrical enclosure, said electrical enclosure enclosing said control circuit, said voice synthesizer, said audio amplifier, said step down voltage regulator, and said rechargeable power source, said electrical enclosure rigidly affixed to said mast; c) said solar panel mounted to said mast; and d) said speaker affixed to said mast; whereby said solar panel, speaker, and said electrical enclosure may be remotely located. 6. An improved apparatus of claim 3 further comprising: a) an electronic switch connected to said control circuit, said electronic switch for disconnecting said means for connecting said solar panel to a rechargeable power source; b) a means for measuring the voltage of said rechargeable power source and charging current from said solar panel, and providing these measurements to said control circuit; and c) a means for said control circuit to evaluate the rechargeable power source voltage and charging current measurements to determine when overcharging is occurring and signaling said electronic switch to disconnect said means for connecting said solar panel to a rechargeable power source; whereby the electronic switch controls the charging of the rechargeable power source by connecting or disconnecting the solar panel from the rechargeable power source. 7. An apparatus for monitoring the positional status of a moveable barrier in an entryway and capable of providing an audible message when that status is altered comprising: a) a positional status sensor for monitoring the position of the moveable barrier and outputting either an open or a closed signal; b) a control circuit connected to said positional status sensor for receiving either the open or the closed signal, said control circuit further comprising a timer, said timer for measuring the time elapsed after the open signal is received, said control circuit for sequentially outputting alert signals at time spaced intervals when the elapsed time exceeds a predetermined time delay and terminating the output of the alert signals when the closed signal is received, and subsequently outputting a stand down signal; c) a voice synthesizer connected to said control circuit, said voice synthesizer for receiving and matching the alert signal or the stand down signal to a predetermined message signal and outputting the message signal; d) an audio amplifier, said audio amplifier connected to said voice synthesizer, said audio amplifier for receiving the message signal and outputting an amplified message signal, and e) a speaker, said speaker connected to said audio amplifier, said speaker for receiving and converting the amplified message signal to an audible message. 8. An improved apparatus of claim 7 further comprising: a) a solar panel to receive and convert light to create a charging current, b) a step-down voltage regulator, said step-down voltage regulator connected to said control circuit and said voice synthesizer, c) a means for connecting said solar panel to a rechargeable power source to receive said charging current, and d) a means for connecting the rechargeable power source to said step-down voltage regulator and to said audio amplifier. 9. An apparatus for monitoring the positional status of a moveable barrier in an entryway and capable of providing an audible message when that status is altered comprising: a) a positional status sensor for monitoring the position of the moveable barrier and outputting either an open or a closed signal; b) a control circuit connected to said positional status sensor for receiving either the open or closed signal, said control circuit further comprising a timer for measuring the time elapsed after the open signal is received; c) a means for said control circuit to sequentially output a plurality of time spaced alert signals when the elapsed time exceeds the time delay, and further terminating the output of the alert signal when the closed signal is received; d) a voice synthesizing means connected to said control circuit for receiving the alert signal and matching the alert signal to a specific message signal and outputting the selected message signal; e) an audio amplifier, said audio amplifier connected to said voice synthesizing means, for receiving and amplifying the message signal to output an amplified message signal; f) a speaker to receive the amplified message signal, said speaker for converting the amplified message signal and outputting an audible message; g) a step-down voltage regulator, said step-down voltage regulator connected to said control circuit and said voice synthesizer; and h) a means for providing power to said step-down voltage regulator and to said audio amplifier.
