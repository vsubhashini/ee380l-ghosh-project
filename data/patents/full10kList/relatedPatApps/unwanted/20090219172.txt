Method of detection according to claim 1 or 2, wherein at least one of the monitoring zones is distinct from at least one other monitoring zone. 5. Method of detection according to claims 1 or 2, wherein each detection performs the acquisition and processing steps at a sufficient frequency to allow at least two acquisitions of a vehicle travelling in the monitoring zone at a given reference speed. 6. Method according to claim 5, wherein the processing of the results is performed at a frequency below or equal to the smallest of the acquisition frequencies. 7. Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein each detection provides at least one item of information regarding the presence of a mobile object in the monitoring zone and a confidence index related to the presence information. 8. Method according to claim 7, wherein each detection provides information regarding direction and/or speed of movement of the mobile object. 9. Method according to claim 7, wherein at least one detection provides information regarding the dimension of the mobile object. 10. Method according to one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the comparison between the result of one of the detections with the result of another detection is performed on the basis of a time offset determined as a function of the speed, optionally of the direction of the movement of the vehicle and of the distance between the monitoring zones for the detections whose results are compared. 11. Method of detection according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that on completion of the processing step at least one of the following items of information is delivered: presence of vehicle, speed of vehicle, average speed, rate of occupancy of the carriageways, flow rate of vehicles, category or size of the vehicles, presence of a vehicle travelling in the wrong direction. 12.
