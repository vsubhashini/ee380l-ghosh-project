An integrated and automated multistation machine is provided for placement and attachment of electrically conductive interconnectors onto solar cells and the like. The machine comprises a rotatable turntable for supporting a plurality of solar cells in respective association with a corresponding plurality of operating stations and then for indexing the solar cells to the next operating stations in sequence. More particularly, the machine includes a cell loading station for transfer of a solar cell from a loading magazine and for precision placement onto one of a plurality of cell-supporting fixtures carried by the turntable. The turntable indexes the solar cells one at a time on the fixtures from the cell loading station first to a flux station whereat a liquid flux material is applied to predetermined points on the cell. The flux-bearing cell is then indexed in sequence to an interconnector dispensing station which places an interconnector at a predetermined point on the solar cell and then to an attachment station which secures the interconnector to the cell as by soldering. Additional pairs of interconnector dispensing and attachment stations may be provided for placing and attaching additional interconnectors onto the cell. The resultant cell/interconnector subassembly is then indexed to an inspection station and finally to a cell unloading station whereat the subassembly is transferred from the cell-supporting fixture and placed into an unloading magazine for removal from the machine.
