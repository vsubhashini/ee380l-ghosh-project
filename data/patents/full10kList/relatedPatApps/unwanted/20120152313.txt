A hybrid solar tracking algorithm is implemented in a two-axis solar tracker mechanism for a concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) system in order to control the movement of the two-axis solar tracker mechanism. The hybrid solar tracking algorithm uses both 1) an Ephemeris calculation and 2) an offset value from a matrix to determine the angular coordinates for the CPV cells contained in the two-axis solar tracker mechanism to be moved to in order to achieve a highest power out of the CPV cells. The matrix populates with data from periodic calibration measurements of actual power being generated by the solar tracker and the tracking algorithm applies Kalman filtering to those measurements over time of the operation of the solar tracking mechanism to create the offset value being applied to the Ephemeris calculation to determine the angular coordinates for the CPV cells.
