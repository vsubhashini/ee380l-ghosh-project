Solar energy collecting apparatus (21) includes a one-piece collector panel (25) having a flat collector plate (27) with an absorber surface (28) provided by an intermediate wall portion of the collector panel. The collector plate forms both a weather membrane over and a part of an airflow passage (26) with support structure having a channel-shaped exterior surface. The collector panel has upper side edge flanges (31, 32) for connecting adjacent edges together along a continuous seam structure and to the support structure so that the collector panel is an integral part of the support structure. A cover assembly includes an outer sheet (51) and an inner sheet (52) with an air space (53) therebetween, together with side edge connecting members (57) that hold the sheets apart and attach to the seam structure formed by connected collector panels. Each side edge connecting member has an upper slot (58) that receives the upper sheet and is held by a locking strip (64) and a lower slot (67) on an incline so that the lower sheet has an edge portion wrapped around a welt (58) that slides into slot (67) in a friction-fitting relationship.
