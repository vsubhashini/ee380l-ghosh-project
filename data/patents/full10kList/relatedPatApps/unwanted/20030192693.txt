A process for utilizing the heat from fluids produced from a hydrocarbon containing formation, which has been treated in situ. The in situ treatment process may include providing heat from one or more heaters to at least a portion of the formation. The heat may be allowed to transfer from one or more heaters to a part of the formation such that heat from the one or more heaters pyrolyzes at least some hydrocarbons within the part of the formation. Hydrocarbons may be produced from the formation. In an embodiment, heat from the produced fluids may be used for other processes. Examples of other processes may include, but are not limited to, hydrotreating, separations, steam cracking, olefin production, etc.
