A water ionizing device which includes an electrode assembly of three electrodes which are preferably concentric. The center electrode is predominantly of silver and the other two electrodes are of copper. Ions are introduced from the silver electrode into water to be treated for a limited period and thereafter ions are introduced into the water alternatively from the other two electrodes. The device is, optionally, solar powered.
Claims I claim: 1. A method for treating water by means of operating a water-ionizing device which includes a first electrode of a first material, a second electrode of a second material, and a third electrode of the said second material, the method including the steps of: (a) at the start of an operational cycle, applying a first DC voltage between the first and third electrodes for a predetermined period thereby to introduce ions from the first electrode into the water which is to be treated; (b) after the said predetermined period, applying a second DC voltage between the second and third electrodes and reversing the polarity of the connection of the second DC voltage to the second and third electrodes at intervals, thereby to introduce ions alternatively from the second and third electrodes into the water; and (c) limiting the current which flows between the second and third electrodes as the total dissolved solid content in the water increases. 2. The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of: (d) generating said first and second DC voltages by solar power. 3. The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of: (e) monitoring the current applied to one of said electrodes to determine electrode wear. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein step (b) further comprises serially reversing the polarity of the second and third electrodes at selected intervals to obtain substantially equivalent wear between the second and third electrodes.
