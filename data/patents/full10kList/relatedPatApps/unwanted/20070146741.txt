The invention relates to a microstructured technological system and, in particular, micromirror arrangements. The aim of the invention is to produce facade elements for buildings having large areas in square centimetres and above, at reduced cost. The entire micromirror arrangement can be produced as a flat, architectonically useable structural element in a modularly replicable manner. According to the invention, the control electronic system, which contains the logics which are controlled as mirror elements, is arranged in the centre of a control device at a specific, remote distance from which an addressing network is used to control the individual mirror elements or modules. Said addressing network is already integrated into the flat modules during production and to a large degree, in the form of printed lines. As a result, the necessity of incorporating silicon-based chip technology into the facade elements, which is expensive, is no longer necessary. Also, essentially less expensive materials than highly pure silicon are used in the production of the micromirror arrangements. Production costs, which are at least in the same size order as other, traditional, high quality faccade elements, result therefrom.
