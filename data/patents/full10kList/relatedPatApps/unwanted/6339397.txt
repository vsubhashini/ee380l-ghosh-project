A portable self-contained tracking unit includes an enclosure attached to a mounting plate, with a hollow interior cavity housing a GPS receiver, a microprocessor and a transmitter. The GPS receiver will receive tracking data and the microprocessor will process the tracking data into a data packet. The transmitter transmits the data packet to a remote receiving station, for transmission to a central database. Photoelectric cells are mounted on the enclosure to recharge batteries which provide power to the electrical components of the tracking unit. The enclosure is designed with a pair of vertically oriented side panels which are generally orthogonally oriented so that the solar panels mounted on the side panels will maintain a favorable solar incidence angle during a wide range of orientations. The transmitter is a cellular telephone with an antenna mounted within the enclosure but spaced a distance from the metal mounting plate and electrical components approximately one-quarter wavelength of the operating frequency of the transmitter. The enclosure is formed of a radio frequency and optically transparent material, so that the antenna and the solar panels may be housed within the hollow interior cavity of the enclosure. In the method of the invention, tracking data is periodically transmitted via cellular phone to a cellular service provider, thence to a data service bureau which sends the data over the Internet to the database of a central server computer. The central server computer will decode the information and provide an interface and value added products such as maps and reports for customers via a web page on the Internet.
