A gutter and sheeting material holding device comprises an elongated body having a bottom wall, and side walls extending from opposed sides of the bottom wall. The bottom and side walls define a gutter for channeling a liquid. Sheet holding channels are provided at a distal end of the side walls. Wedges are inserted into the sheet holding channels for anchoring sheets or membranes to the side walls of the gutter.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A periodically shieldable solar structure comprising an inner membrane and an outer membrane defining therebetween an internal cavity, a foam generating system for selectively filling said internal cavity with degradable foam, said inner and outer membranes being united along a lower end thereof by a first gutter interposed between the inner and outer membranes and defining a top open-ended channel for receiving and channeling the liquid resulting from foam degradation, the first gutter having a mounting flange mounted to a second gutter provided at a lower end of a slope defined by the outer membrane for collecting and carrying off rain water flowing over the outer membrane, the first gutter further having first and second side walls provided with respective sheet holding means for respectively fixedly anchoring said inner and outer membranes to said first and second side walls of said gutter, said first and second side walls having an inner face forming part of a boundary wall of the channel receiving the liquid resulting from foam degradation, the sheet holding means of the first side wall being provided on said inner face, the sheet holding means of the second side wall being provided in an outer face thereof opposite to said inner face. 2. The periodically shieldable solar structure defined in claim 1, wherein the first and second opposed side walls each terminate into a female locking part adapted to receive a separate mating insert, the inner and outer membranes being captively retained between the female locking part and the corresponding mating insert. 3. A fastening device for fixing first and second membranes to a framework, comprising a main member adapted to be mounted to the framework, said main member having first and second arms interconnected by a bottom web, said bottom web and said first and second arms forming a gutter, said first and second arms being respectively provided with first and second sheet keeper receiving channels at respective distal end portions thereof relative to said bottom web, said first and second arms having opposed inner facing surfaces, said first and second sheet keeper receiving channels being adapted to respectively receive first and second sheet keepers in locking engagement therewithin in order to respectively fixedly hold one end of the first and second membranes in said first and second sheet keeper receiving channels such that the gutter extends between the membranes the first sheet keeper receiving channel being defined in the inner facing surface of the first arm, whereas the second sheet keeper receiving channel being defined in an outer facing surface of the second arm opposite said inner facing surface thereof.
