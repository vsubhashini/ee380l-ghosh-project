An forced-air to liquid heat exchanger is used in or adjacent to the attic space of an unmodified residential or commercial building to transfer the latent solar gained heat to a swimming pool, while cooling the attic space and thereby lowering the energy cost of cooling the living space of the said building. The roof material serves as a solar collector, while the attic space provides a temporary storage medium. The present invention allows the transfer of this solar energy to a swimming pool in a very low cost method. The present invention can lower the building summer cooling utility costs by cooling the attic space of the building, while very inexpensively raising the swimming pool temperature and extending the usability season of the swimming pool.
Claims 1. A modular swimming pool water heating system comprising a fan shroud and drip pan for mounting in or near the attic of a building; a heat exchange unit mounted to said fan shroud and used for introducing swimming pool water into said heat exchange unit; a ducted fan unit for mounting on fan shroud for pushing air into said fan shroud and through said heat exchange unit; flexible duct for connection to said inlet of said ducted fan for receiving warm attic air from the peak and hottest locations of the attic and feeding said air to said fan shroud and heat exchanger for transfer to the pool water circulating through the heat exchanger, thus transferring the attic heat to the connected swimming pool. 2. The system of claim 1 is easily adaptable to commercially available solar heater controllers, of which are not covered or discussed further in this claim.
