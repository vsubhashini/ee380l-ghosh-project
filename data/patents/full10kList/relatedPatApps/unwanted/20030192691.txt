A method is described for inhibiting migration of fluids into and/or out of a treatment area undergoing an in situ conversion process. Barriers in the formation proximate a treatment area may be used to inhibit migration of fluids. Inhibition of migration of fluids may occur before, during, and/or after an in situ treatment process. For example, migration of fluids may be inhibited while heat is provided from heaters to at least a portion of the treatment area. Barriers may include naturally occurring portions (e.g., overburden, and/or underburden) and/or installed portions.
