A container for accommodating a solar ray-collecting device comprises a cylindrical body and a transparent dome mounted on the body for accommodating therein the solar ray-collecting device. A fin for mounting the dome on the cylindrical body is unitarily attached to the lower opening end of the dome. The cylindrical body has therein a stand for carrying thereon the solar ray-collecting device. The lower end of the cylindrical body is cut off along the slanted surface of the roof.
Claims We claim: 1. A solar ray-collecting device mountable on a roof of a building in which said roof is inclined relative to horizontal, comprising a cylindrical body having a longitudinal axis and upper and lower longitudinal ends, a transparent dome, mounting means mounting said transparent dome on said upper longitudinal end of said cylindrical body, said mounting means comprising a flange extending from said transparent dome, a receptacle member on said upper longitudinal end of said cylindrical body, a joint member interposed between said flange and said receptacle member, first fastening means fastening said joint member to said flange, and second fastening means fastening said joint member and said receptacle member to said upper longitudinal end of said cylindrical body, solar ray-collecting means disposed within said transparent dome, said lower longitudinal end of said cylindrical body being disposed at an inclined angle relative to said longitudinal axis of said cylindrical body, said inclined angle corresponding to the incline of said inclined roof, securing means connected to said lower longitudinal end of said cylindrical body for securing said cylindrical body to said inclined roof such that said lower end of said cylindrical body is thereby mountable on said inclined roof with said longitudinal axis of said cylindrical body being disposed vertically upright, said solar ray-collecting means comprising an optical conductor cable means passing through said cylindrical body and extending through an opening in said roof to thereby conduct collected solar rays to the interior of said building. 2. The combination comprising a solar raycollecting device and an inclined roof structure of a building on which said solar ray-collecting device is mounted, said solar ray-collecting device comprising a cylindrical body having a longitudinal axis and upper and lower longitudinal ends, a transparent dome mounted on said upper longitudinal end of said cylindrical body, solar ray-collecting means disposed within said transparent dome, said lower longitudinal end of said cylindrical body being disposed at an inclined angle relative to said longitudinal axis of said cylindrical body, said inclined angle corresponding to the incline of said inclined roof structure, securing means connected to said lower longitudinal end of said cylindrical body and to said inclined roof structure for securing said cylindrical body to said inclined roof structure such that said lower longitudinal end of said cylindrical body is thereby mounted on said inclined roof structure with said longitudinal axis of said cylindrical body being disposed vertically upright, said roof structure having a first opening underlying said cylindrical body, a transparent means mounted in said first opening for passing solar rays to the interior of said building, said solar ray-collecting means comprising an optical conductor cable means passing through said cylindrical body, and a second opening in said inclined roof structure, said cable means extending through said second opening to thereby conduct collected solar rays to the interior of said building. 3. The combination according to claim 2, wherein said opening means through which said cable means extends underlies said cylindrical body.
