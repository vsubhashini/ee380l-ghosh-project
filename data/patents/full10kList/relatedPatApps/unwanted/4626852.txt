Lantern employs clear lens protective cover around the drum lens and a clear dome over the solar panel mounted above the lens. A heavily damped gimbal supported by the lantern housing mounts the lens, lampchanger, and flasher above a bank of batteries suspended from the gimbal. The weight of the batteries aids in providing a righting moment to the gimbal when the marine buoy, atop of which the lantern is secured, is tilted or inclined for sustained periods due to current and/or wind. Interior of the lantern is readily accessible by merely pivoting upwardly an annulus supporting the lens cover, solar panel, and dome.
Claims I claim: 1. Integrated and unitary lantern apparatus for mounting on a marine buoy and readily removable therefrom as a unit, said apparatus comprising, in combination, a lantern housing at a lower portion of said lantern apparatus. components including a clear lens cover, a solar panel, and a clear dome, each of said components disposed above said housing in sequential order abovementioned and supported by said component immediately therebelow, a gimbal having an outer frame, and an inner frame supported therein by first pivot shafts communicating therebetween, said outer frame pivotally mounted to and supported by support means secured diametrically to said housing, said outer frame pivotally mounted to said support means on second pivot shafts, damping means associated with one each of said first and second pivot shafts, said inner frame and said outer frame pivotable substantially independently to each other and sustained tilting of said buoy, said outer frame pivotable in a direction normal to the direction of pivot of said inner frame, drum lens mounted on said inner frame thereabove, means for supplying light to said lens for transmission thereby, a bank of batteries suspended from said inner frame for providing a righting moment to said gimbal when said buoy is tilted or inclined for a sustained period by currents and/or wind, said lantern being devoid of counterweight means, said batteries providing electric power to said means for supplying light, transparent shielding means for protecting said lens and gimbal from a marine environment, said solar panel providing power to recharge said batteries, said solar panel having a circular tray for receiving said lens cover for support thereon, said tray containing solar cells for receiving radiation from the sun, said lens cover having a plurality of vent holes adjacent an upper portion thereof to permit escape of hydrogen gas therethrough when said batteries are charged by power generated by said solar cells of said solar panel, said support means for supporting said gimbal outer frame to said housing comprising support members mounted therebetween carrying a pair of mating annuli thereon hingedly separable from each other by hinge means articulating therebetween, said lens cover supported on upper of said mating annuli and pivotable on said hinge means to provide ready access to interior of said lantern apparatus while permitting said drum lens supported on said inner gimbal frame thereabove and said batteries suspended from said inner gimbal frame therebelow to remain substantially vertically disposed independently of such pivoting on said hinge means, said batteries suspended from said inner frame of said gimbal providing vertically to said lantern apparatus when said marine buoy is heeling up to above 11.degree. from vertical due to wind and/or current, and bolt-down means articulating between said lantern housing and marine buoy permitting said lantern apparatus to be readily removed therefrom.
