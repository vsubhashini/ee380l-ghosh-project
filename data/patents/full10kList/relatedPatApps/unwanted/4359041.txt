A device for concentrating light to a focal region. The device includes a plurality of segments which are capable of reflecting light and which are arranged for rotation about two axes, one offset with respect to the other. The segments are mutually co-operable to pivot in unison about the two axes in order to direct light to the focal region. A light energy receiving medium is generally positioned in the focal region.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar concentrating reflector assembly comprising: a frame; a plurality of half-parabolically shaped reflector segments, each segment having one end defining the vertex of said half-parabola and the other end defining the aperture of said half-parabola; mounting means for pivotably attaching each of said segments to said frame for rotation about a first axis, said first axis defined by a line connecting the vertex end of the segment with the aperture end of the segment, said segments forming a half-parabolically shaped trough when not pivoted; one end of said first axes being longitudinally offset from an imaginary plane perpendicular to the axis of the half-parabolically shaped trough by an amount equal to: where the aperture width is equal to twice the perpendicular distance from the aperture of the half-parabolic trough to its vertex and the focal length is the distance from the vertex to the focal point divided by twice the aperture width; a light energy receiving medium mounted along a line formed by the loci of the foci of each half-parabolically shaped segment when said segments are not pivoted; means for pivoting said segments in unison about said first axes; means for pivoting said frame about a second axis, said second axis being defined by a line on which said energy receiving medium is fixed. 2. The solar concentrating reflector assembly of claim 1 wherein each side of said segment is shaped as an arc having a radius: ##EQU2## where the parabola depth is the perpendicular distance from a plane passing through a segments aperture to the segments vertex.
