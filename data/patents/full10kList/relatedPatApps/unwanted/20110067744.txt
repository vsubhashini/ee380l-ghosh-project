A direct current (DC) power system uses High Concentration Photovoltaic (HCPV) modules and Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) module. Power outputs of the HCPV/BIPV modules are mixed to improve utilization of generated power. Thus, solar power is used through best power control and energy conservation.
Claims 1. A direct-current (DC) power system using High Concentration Photovoltaic (HCPV) and Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) modules, the DC power system comprising: a solar energy module, said solar energy module transforming solar energy into electric energy to be output through a DC bus; a storage bank, said storage bank being a storage device of solar energy that charges and discharges electric energy and buffers a voltage on said DC bus; a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) converter, said MPPT converter being connected between said solar energy module and said storage bank, said MPPT converter saving energy outputted from said solar energy module into said storage bank, said MPPT converter stabilizing voltage outputted from said solar energy module and outputting said voltage from said solar energy module into said DC bus, said MPPT converter monitoring a voltage on said DC bus to escape said storage bank and close said DC power system when said monitored voltage is greater than a preset value; and an inverter, said inverter being connected with an alternative-current (AC) grid through said DC bus. 2. The DC power system according to claim 1, wherein said solar energy module comprises more than two HCPV modules and a BIPV module, and wherein each of said HCPV modules is equipped with an active sun tracker. 3. The DC power system according to claim 2, wherein a maximum power is tracked through a polynomial relation of said HCPV module coordinated with said BIPV module. 4. The DC power system according to claim 1, wherein said storage bank is a set of storage devices shunted with said DC bus.
