A solar ray collecting device in which solar rays are focused by a lens and guided into an optical fiber and transmitted through the optical conductor onto an adequate desired portion for use in illumination or for others purposes. A solar ray collecting portion is comprised of a large number of lenses arranged on a common plane and optical fibers, the light-receiving edge of which are precisely positioned at the focal position of the respective lenses, a horizontal hollow shaft for rotatably supporting the solar ray collecting portion, and a vertical hollow rotating shaft elongated in a direction perpendicular to the horizontal hollow shaft and supporting the same unitarily. A drive means rotatably moves the solar ray collecting portion mounted on the horizontal hollow shaft around the same.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar ray collecting device comprising a solar ray collecting portion consisting of a large number of lenses arranged on a common plane, optical fibers having light-receiving edges which are precisely positioned at the focus position of the respective lenses means for rotatively supporting said solar ray collecting portion, a horizontal hollow shaft supporting said supporting means for allowing rotation about a horizontal axis of rotation, a vertical hollow rotating shaft elongated in a direction perpendicular to said horizontal hollow shaft and supporting said horizontal hollow shaft, said vertical shaft being rotatable about a vertical axis of rotation, drive means for rotating said solar ray collecting portion about said horizontal axis of rotation, said solar ray collecting portion unitarily comprising an approximately semicircular arc gear having an axis of rotation coincident with said horizontal axis of rotation, said drive means comprising a bearing means mounting said semicircular arc gear on said horizontal hollow shaft such that said semicircular arc gear is rotatable relative to said horizontal hollow shaft, said drive means further comprising a motor means mounted on said horizontal hollow shaft and a drive gear driven by said motor means and engaging said semicircular arc gear such that said solar ray collecting portion can be directed toward the sun as said drive means rotates said solar ray collecting portion about said horizontal axis of rotation and rotation is effected about said vertical axis of rotation, said horizontal hollow shaft having two longitudinal ends and a horizontal internal passage extending between said two longitudinal ends, said vertical hollow shaft having an upper longitudinal end and a vertical internal passage, said vertical internal passage having a longitudinal axis coincident with said vertical axis of rotation, said vertical hollow shaft being unitarily joined to said horizontal hollow shaft at an intermediate position of said horizontal hollow shaft located between said two longitudinal ends of said horizontal hollow shaft, said optical fibers passing into each of said two longitudinal ends of said horizontal hollow shaft into said horizontal internal passage and then into said upper longitudinal end of said vertical hollow shaft into said vertical internal passage. 2. A solar ray collecting device according to claim 1, wherein said semicircular arc gear has internal gear teeth. 3. A solar ray collecting device according to claim 1, wherein some of said optical fibers pass into one of said two longitudinal ends of said horizontal hollow shaft and the remainder of said optical fibers pass into the other of said two longitudinal ends of said horizontal hollow shaft, all of said optical fibers passing into said upper longitudinal end of said vertical hollow shaft. 4. A solar ray collecting device according to claim 1, wherein said vertical hollow shaft is unitarily joined to the mid section of said horizontal hollow shaft. 5. A solar ray collecting device as defined in claim 1, further comprising a transparent cover covering said lens in said solar ray collecting portion.
