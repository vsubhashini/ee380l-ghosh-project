An elongated roof profile and a solar panel having a profiled edge molding are secured together by a separate retaining profile between the edge molding and roof profile and having formations engaging the roof profile and preventing movement of the retaining profile relative thereto generally parallel to a plane of the panel, formations engaging the roof profile and preventing movement of the retaining profile relative thereto transverse to the plane, formations engaging the edge molding and preventing movement of the retaining profile relative thereto generally parallel to the plane, and formations engaging the edge molding and preventing movement of the retaining profile relative thereto transverse to the plane.
Claims I claim: 1. In combination: a solar panel lying in a plane and having a profiled edge molding; an elongated roof profile juxtaposed with the edge molding and having at least one elongated arm transverse to the plane and having an upper edge provided with a short lip generally parallel to the plane; and a mounting profile between the edge molding and roof profile and formed with formations engaging the roof profile and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto generally parallel to the plane, formations engaging the roof profile and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto transverse to the plane, formations engaging the edge molding and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto generally parallel to the plane, and formations engaging the short lip of the arm of the edge molding and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative to the edge molding transverse to the plane. 2. The solar-panel mounting system defined in claim 1 wherein the formations preventing movement of the mounting profile relative to the roof profile generally parallel to the plane include a pair of arms projecting downward from the mounting profile and embracing the one arm of the roof profile. 3. The solar-panel mounting system defined in claim 2 wherein the formations preventing movement of the mounting profile relative to the roof profile transverse to the plane include a tab projecting from one of retaining-profile arms and engaging underneath the short lip of the roof-profile arm. 4. In combination: an elongated roof profile; a solar panel lying in a plane and having a profiled edge molding juxtaposed with the roof profile and having at least one elongated leg extending transverse to the plane and having a lower edge provided with a short lip extending generally parallel to the plane; and a mounting profile between the edge molding and roof profile and formed with formations engaging the roof profile and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto generally parallel to the plane, formations engaging the roof profile and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto transverse to the plane, formations engaging the edge molding, preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto generally parallel to the plane, and including a pair of parallel and upwardly directed arms at least one of which engages the edge-molding leg, and formations engaging the edge molding and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto transverse to the plane. 5. The solar-panel mounting system defined in claim 4 wherein one of the retaining-profile arms is formed with a lip directed generally parallel to the plane, engaged behind the lip of the edge-molding leg, and constituting the formation preventing movement of the mounting profile relative to the edge molding transverse to the plane. 6. In combination: an elongated roof profile; a solar panel lying in a plane and having a profiled edge molding juxtaposed with the roof profile and having at least one elongated leg extending transverse to the plane and having a lower edge provided with a short lip extending generally parallel to the plane; and a mounting profile between the edge molding and roof profile and formed with formations engaging the roof profile and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto generally parallel to the plane, formations engaging the roof profile and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto transverse to the plane, formations engaging the edge molding, preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto generally parallel to the plane, and including a pair of parallel and upwardly directed arms flanking and capturing the edge-molding leg, and formations engaging the edge molding and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto transverse to the plane. 7. In combination: an elongated roof profile; a solar panel lying in a plane and having a profiled edge molding juxtaposed with the roof panel and having at least one elongated leg extending transverse to the plane and having a lower edge provided with a short lip extending generally parallel to the plane and another such elongated leg transverse to the plane and having a lower edge provided with a short lip extending generally parallel to the plane; and a mounting profile between the edge molding and roof profile and formed with formations engaging the roof profile and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto generally parallel to the plane, formations engaging the roof profile and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto transverse to the plane, formations engaging the edge molding and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto generally parallel to the plane, and formations engaging the edge molding and preventing movement of the mounting profile relative thereto transverse to the plane, an elastically deflectable elongated rib extending transverse to the plane and having an outer edge formed with a barb engaged behind one of the lips of the edge molding and constituting the formation preventing movement of the mounting profile relative to the edge molding transverse to the plane.
