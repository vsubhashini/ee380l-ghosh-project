A method for treating a relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons in situ may include providing heat from one or more heat sources to a selected section of the formation. The heat provided to the selected section may pyrolyze at least some hydrocarbons in a lower portion of the formation. A mixture of hydrocarbons may be produced from an upper portion of the formation. The mixture of hydrocarbons may include at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons from the lower portion of the formation.
