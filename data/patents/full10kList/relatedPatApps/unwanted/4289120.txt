A solar heat collecting device is provided which is modular in design and easily removable from its location adjacent the roof or wall of a structure, into the interior thereof for maintainance without disturbing the exterior surface of the roof or wall and thereby eliminates many of the difficulties associated with removal and maintainance of prior art collectors which are only removable from the exterior of the structure. The present invention reduces the possibility of leakage in the roof or wall where normal solar collectors would be secured and removed. The device includes a box-like housing having a substantial planar base portion and four upstanding side walls, an insulation disposed inside the housing and extending coextensive with the base portion, a solar heat collection member disposed within the housing which has associated conduits for circulating heat conducting fluid therethrough for use at a remote location, a transparent cover member permanently securable to the outer surface of the wall or roof of the structure to become a part thereof and which overly covers an opening defined in the wall or roof of substantially coextensive dimensions with the housing and in which the housing is inserted from the inside of the structure, and brackets mounting the housing within the opening defined in the wall or roof for easy removal into the interior of the structure for service or maintainance of the solar heat collection device without removal of the transparent cover member which is permanently secured to the outer surface of the structure.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar heat collecting device comprising: a wall or roof portion of a structure defining an opening therein; a box-like housing of generally rectangular cross section substantially coextensive with and positionable in said opening defined in said wall or roof and having a substantially planar base portion and four upstanding side walls connected thereto; insulation means disposed inside said housing and extending substantially coextensive with the base portion thereof; solar heat collection means disposed within said housing above said insulation means parallel to said base portion of said housing and having means for circulating a heat conducting fluid therethrough to and from a remote location; a transparent cover member extending beyond said side wall portions of said housing and permanently securable to the outer surface of said wall or roof of said structure and overly covering said opening defined in said wall or roof of substantially coextensive rectangular cross section as said housing; means fixedly securing said cover member to said wall or roof; and means for mounting said housing within said opening defined in said wall or roof for removal into the interior of said structure for service and maintenance of said solar heat collection means without removal of said transparent cover member from said wall or roof of said structure. 2. A solar collection device as defined in claim 1 wherein said mounting means includes: a resilient sealing member engaging the upper edges of said side wall portions in said housing around the entire periphery thereof for providing sealing engagement with the back side of said transparent cover member; a framing member located within said wall or roof opening; bracket members removably mountable to said framing members on the inside of said wall or roof immediately adjacent said opening defined therein, and which brackets contact the outside surface of said base portion of said housing to hold said housing in position in said opening in said wall or roof. 3. A solar heat collecting device as defined in claim 2 wherein said means for circulating fluid through said solar heat collection means includes: conduits mounted to the interior of said structure for transporting said fluid to and from a remote location from said collection means for use; means for releasably coupling end portions of said conduits to said collection means. 4. In a structure having upstanding walls and an overly covering roof with a generally rectangular opening defined in either said wall or roof, the improvement comprising: a box-like housing member of generally rectangular cross section substantially coextensive with said opening in said structure and having a substantially planar base portion and four upstanding side walls connected thereto; insulation means disposed inside said housing and extending substantially coextensive with the base portion of said housing; solar heat collection means disposed within said housing above said insulation means parallel to said base portion of said housing and having means for circulating a heat conducting fluid therethrough to and from a remote location; a transparent cover member extending beyond said side side wall portions of said housing overly covering said opening defined in said wall or roof; means fixedly securing said cover member to said wall or roof; and means for mounting said housing within said opening defined in said wall or roof for removal into the interior of said structure for service and maintenance of said solar heat collection means without removal of said transparent cover member from said wall or roof. 5. A structure as defined in claim 4 wherein said mounting means includes a framing member secured to said structure immediately adjacent and on at least two opposing sides of said opening in said wall or roof extending inwardly on the inside of said structure and said means for mounting said housing includes brackets removably secured to said framing member and extending under the back surface of the base portion of said housing to hold said housing in place adjacent the back side of said cover member; and resilient sealing means engaging the upper edges of said side wall portions of said housing and sandwiched between the cover member and the side wall portions of the housing to provide a seal between said housing and said cover member. 6. A structure as defined in claim 5 wherein said means for circulating fluid through said solar heat collection means includes: conduits mounted to the interior of said structure for transporting said fluid to and from a remote location from said collection means for use; means for releasably coupling end portions of said conduits to said collection means.
