A reflector for photovoltaic power generation is characterized by the use of a color coating on the surface of the reflector material which is stable to ultraviolet light. The reflector includes a substrate and a layer of high purity aluminum on the substrate. The aluminum layer is anodized and coated with a gold dye so that the reflector has a reflectivity which is high for long wave, near infrared, and red to green light, moderate for blue light, and low for ultraviolet light. When such a reflector is arranged adjacent to a photovoltaic panel, it reflects additional sunlight onto the panel to increase the electrical output of the panel without damaging the solar collector material of the panel.
