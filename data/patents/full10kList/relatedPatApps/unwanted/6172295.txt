A high-quality solar battery module having an excellent adhesive property, weathering resistance, and reliability of battery function and a method of assembling the same are disclosed. The solar battery module is constituted of a solar cell panel provided with solar cell elements arranged on the back said of a transmitting panel opposite to the light-receiving surface of the light-transmitting panel; and a frame provided with plate or flange projecting therefrom and arranged over the entire periphery of the panel in order to support the back side of the light-transmitting panel and keeps the light-receiving surface in open. The solar cell panel is bonded to the projecting plate of the frame with a moisture curing hot-melt adhesive composed mainly of a polymer containing at least two hydrolytic silyl group in one molecule.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar battery panel module which comprises: a) a solar battery panel comprised of a light-transmission plate and a solar battery element, the solar battery element being provided on a surface of the solar battery panel opposed to a light-receiving surface of the light-transmission plate; and b) a frame for mounting said solar battery panel provided with a flange or projecting plate for supporting the periphery of an end portion of the solar battery panel at a surface side opposed to the light-receiving surface of the light-transmission plate in a manner to permit the light-receiving surface of the light-transmission plate to be in an opened state; wherein, the solar battery panel is fixed onto the projecting plate of the frame by a moisture curing hot-melt type adhesive containing, as a main component, a polymer having at least two selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, mercapto, mono-substituted amino, and non-substituted amino groups as a functional group capable of reacting with an isocyanate group, and wherein at least two hydrolytic silyl groups are introduced into one molecule via a urethane bond with the functional group. 2. A method of assembling a solar battery module, which comprises: melt-applying a moisture curing hot-melt type adhesive containing, as a main component, a polymer on a projecting plate of a frame for mounting a solar battery element, said polymer having at least two selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, mercapto, mono-substituted amino and non-substituted amino groups as a functional group capable of reacting with an isocyanate group, and further at least two hydrolytic silyl groups are introduced into one molecule via a urethane bond with the functional group: followed by mounting a solar battery panel on the projecting plate of the frame; and solidifying the moisture curing hot-melt type adhesive with cooling to achieve an initial adhesive strength, and further completely solidifying the adhesive by moisture curing to fix a solar battery panel onto the projecting plate of the frame.
