Controlling a solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant to provide supplemental heat includes receiving concentrated solar power thermal energy from a concentrated solar power (CSP) field for use in a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) that uses waste heat thermal energy from waste heat produced by a gas combustion process and the concentrated solar power thermal energy to produce steam to drive a steam generator. Supplemental fossil fuel generated heat is added to the (HRSG) such that the temperature of steam produced by the (HRSG) is maintained within an inlet operating tolerance of the steam generator when the concentrated solar power thermal energy contribution to the (HRSG) falls below a predetermined threshold.
Claims 1. A method of controlling a solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant, the method comprising: receiving concentrated solar power thermal energy from a concentrated solar power (CSP) field; feeding the concentrated solar power thermal energy into a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG); causing the (HRSG) to receive waste heat thermal energy from waste heat produced by a gas combustion process, the gas combustion process used for driving a gas turbine; causing the (HRSG) to use the concentrated solar power thermal energy and the waste heat thermal energy to produce steam to drive a steam generator; and causing a supplemental fossil fuel generated heat to be added to the (HRSG) such that temperature of steam produced by the (HRSG) is maintained within an inlet operating tolerance of the steam generator, the supplemental fossil fuel generated heat being added to the (HRSG) if the concentrated solar power thermal energy contribution to the (HRSG) falls below a predetermined threshold. 2. The method of claim 14, further including: storing in a database a plurality of operational rules governing the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant operation of adding supplemental fossil fuel generated heat to the HRSG in which predefined atmospheric conditions are predicted to occur in proximity to the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant; receiving atmospheric condition prediction information relating to an atmospheric event; retrieving an operational rule from the plurality of operational rules that relates to the atmospheric event; and controlling an aspect of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant in accordance with the retrieved operational rule. 3. The method of claim 14, further including: storing in a database a plurality of operational rules governing the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant operation of adding supplemental fossil fuel generated heat to the HRSG in which predefined atmospheric conditions are predicted to occur in proximity to the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant; operating the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant by a selected operational rule, from the plurality of operational rules, in accordance with the predicted atmospheric event; causing a learning system to monitor a performance aspect of the solar-fossil-fuel hybrid power plant during its operation in accordance with the selected operational rule during the predicted atmospheric event; and causing the learning system to modify the selected operational rule based on a learned behavior determined in response to the monitoring step.
