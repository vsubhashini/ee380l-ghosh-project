The high density, third dimension geometry solar panels consist of closely placing any type of conventional solar cells in an in depth, oblique attitude to the sun's normal rays. In one panel arrangement, highly polished side reflectors are applied to reflect the sun's rays into the underside groups of solar cells so that a minimum of surface area is required for a higher than normal electrical power yield from the high density cells. The most effective geometric shape for these reflected type of solar panels is the triform, or tri-panel, and modifications of the triform cross-section. Another type of high density solar panel is the V form, or Vee cavity form in which the individual solar cells must have reflective surfaces, for mutual reflection and solar energy concentration.
