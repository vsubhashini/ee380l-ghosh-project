A novel optical design based on a faceted conical or curved reflector centered within an upward facing circular array of light emitting diodes (LED) and protected by a transparent cover.
Claims We claim: 1. A solar-powered navigational light beacon, comprising: a housing; at least one solar panel mounted on said housing; said housing including a mounting surface supporting a substantially planar circuit board thereon; a reflector defining a smooth curve resolved about an axis, said revolved reflector having the aspect of an inverted cone truncated at its vertex and having a base axially opposed to said vertex; said vertex of said revolved reflector being truncated by a substantially planar surface of said circuit board; only one circular array of light emitting diodes having a Lambertian output pattern and being mounted on said circuit board, said circular array encircling said truncated vertex and having a diameter; said base of said revolved reflective surface having a diameter that is larger than the diameter of said circular array; said surface of said reflector comprising a first point located within 20% of 0.995 units of measure in a vertical direction and 20% of 1.697 units of measure in a horizontal direction from a location on said circular array; said surface of said reflector further comprising a second point located within 20% of 0.31 units of measure in said vertical direction and 20% of 0.072 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; and said surface of said array comprising a third point located within 20% of 0.175 units of measure in said vertical direction and 20% of -0.061 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; said first, second and third points lying in a common plane; said beacon being configured to simultaneously emit a substantially horizontal fan of light about 360 degrees; and a circumferentially transparent cylindrical cover encasing said reflector. 2. The light beacon of claim 1 wherein said surface of said reflector passes through: a fourth point located within 10% of 0.380 units of measure in said vertical direction and 10% of 0.217 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; and a fifth point located within 10% of 0.08 units of measure in said vertical direction and 10% of -0.101 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; and, wherein said fourth and fifth points lie in said common plane. 3. The light beacon of claim 2 wherein said surface of said reflector passes through: a sixth point located within 5% of 0.05 units of measure in said vertical direction and 5% of -0.111 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; a seventh point located within 5% of 0.12 units of measure in said vertical direction and 5% of -0.084 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; and an eighth point located within 5% of 0.22 units of measure in said vertical direction and 5% of -0.008 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; and, wherein said sixth, seventh and eighth points lie in said common plane. 4. The light beacon of claim 1 wherein said surface of said reflector passes through: a fourth point located within 10% of 0.590 units of measure in said vertical direction and 10% of 0.432 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; and a fifth point located within 10% of 0.11 units of measure in said vertical direction and 10% of -0.106 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; and, wherein said fourth and fifth points lie in said common plane. 5. The light beacon of claim 2 wherein said surface of said reflector passes through: a sixth point located within 5% of 0.25 units of measure in said vertical direction and 5% of -0.018 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; a seventh point located within 5% of 0.15 units of measure in said vertical direction and 5% of -0.084 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; and an eighth point located within 5% of 0.06 units of measure in said vertical direction and 5% of -0.112 units of measure in said horizontal direction from said location; and, wherein said sixth, seventh and eighth points lie is said common plane.
