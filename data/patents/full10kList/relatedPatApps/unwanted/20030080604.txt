An oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. Fluid migration into and/or out of a treatments area in the formation may be inhibited. In some embodiments, a barrier may be used to inhibit migration of fluids into and/or out of the treatment area. Heat may be provided to the treatment area and subsequently, hydrocarbons, H.sub.2, and/or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation.
