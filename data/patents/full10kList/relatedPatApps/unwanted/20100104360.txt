The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 2, wherein one of the lanes is restricted to motorcycles. 6. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising a plurality of solar power panels disposed on the slanted roof, the solar power panels providing electric power for the services module. 7. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 6, further comprising: a plurality of spindles; and protective covers attached to the plurality of spindles, the spindles removably placing the protective covers over the solar panels. 8. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising a plurality of vertical support columns, each of the vertical support columns extending upward from the lower road to support the upper road and to support the services module floor. 9. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising: at least one central support column; and a rail car system disposed on either side of the at least one central support column. 10. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising roadway landscaping adjacent to the structure. 11. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising: supports for wind-powered generators, the supports being attached to the roof; wind-powered generators attached to the wind-powered generator supports, the wind-powered generators supplying power to the services module. 12. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising wireless telecommunications equipment disposed on the roof. 13. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising: a catchment storage system; and a water pump, the water pump being operably connected to the catchment storage system, the water pump distributing water to clean the solar panels and moisten the ecosystem proximate the roadway. 14. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising a banner display mechanism disposed along sidewalls of the upper deck, the banner display mechanism displaying notices to users of the roadway. 15. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising: a package conveyor system disposed in the services module. 16. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising: electronic sensor circuitry disposed in proximity to the roadway, the electronic sensor circuitry monitoring roadway traffic for compliance of traffic and noise rules. 17. The double-deck covered roadway according to claim 1, further comprising: a control system connected to the electronic sensor circuitry, the control system directing roadway traffic into a pattern that enables a rule-violating user to be trapped and apprehended. 18. A computer-implemented method for use with a double-deck covered roadway, comprising the steps of scanning for a code disposed on vehicles using the roadway; flashing a sign instructing a driver to exit at the next exit if the code is not on the driver's vehicle or is invalid for a roadway level being used by the driver; and issuing and mailing a ticket to the driver if the no code or invalid code condition occurs on the driver's vehicle a predetermined number of times.
