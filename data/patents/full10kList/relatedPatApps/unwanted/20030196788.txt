A method for treating a hydrocarbon containing formation is provided. In one embodiment, heat from one or more heaters may be provided to at least a portion of the formation. Heat may be allowed to transfer from the one or more heaters to at least a part of the formation. In certain embodiments, the heat from the one or more heaters may pyrolyze at least some hydrocarbons within the formation. In an embodiment, a first fluid may be introduced into at least a portion of the formation. The portion may have previously undergone an in situ conversion process. A mixture of the first fluid and a second fluid (or a second compound) may be produced from the formation. In some embodiments, a first fluid may be provided to the formation prior to pyrolyzing hydrocarbons in the formation, and a second fluid (or a second compound) may be produced prior to pyrolyzing hydrocarbons in the formation. In some embodiments the second fluid or second compound include minerals, metals, salts, or other compounds that may be recovered.
