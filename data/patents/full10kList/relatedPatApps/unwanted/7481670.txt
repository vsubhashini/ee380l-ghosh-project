A quick secure connection system for use with a set of outdoor lights includes a power source having a two-wired female connector surrounded by external threads. Threadably connected to the female connector on the power source is a male connector surrounded by an internally threaded collar. The male connector is mounted on one end of a power transmission cord. On the opposite end of the power transmission is a two-wired light assembly. On the base of the two-wired light assembly is another two-wired female connector from which a set of outdoor lights may be assembled.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A quick secure connection system for a set of outdoor lights connected to a power source, said quick secure connection system comprising: a separate mounting block affixed in each light fixture in the set of outdoor lights, each of said mounting blocks including a pair of wires electrically connected to a light source in said respective light fixture in the set of outdoor lights; a power cord extending away from said mounting block; a female connector formed in said mounting block and electrically connected to said pair of wires and said power cord; said female connector being surrounded by an externally threaded housing; a male connector electrically connected to a distal end of said power cord, said male connector constructed and arranged for interlitment with said female connector said male connector including an internally threaded collar surrounding the power cord and the male connector; whereby electrical connection of each light in the set of outdoor lights is made by interfitment of the male connector of a first light fixture into the female connector of a second light fixture and threadable engagement of said internally threaded collar with said externally threaded housing. 2. A set of outdoor lights comprising: a two-wired electrical power source, said power source having a main two-wired female connector formed therein, said main two-wired female connector being surrounded by an externally threaded housing; a first light fixture assembly having a first mounting block affixed therein, said first mounting block including a first two-wired power cord extending away from said first mounting block, said first two-wired power cord having a first two-wired male connector electrically connected to a distal end of said first two-wired power cord, said first two-wired male connector constructed and arranged for interfitment with said main two-wired female connector formed in said power source; said first two-wired male connector including an internally threaded collar surrounding the first two-wired power cord and the first two-wired male connector: a first pair of wires electrically connected to a first two-wired electrical light in said first light fixture; and a first two-wired female connector formed in said first mounting block and electrically connected to said first two-wired power cord; said first female connector being surrounded by an externally threaded housing; a second light fixture assembly having a second mounting block affixed therein, said second mounting block including a second two-wired power cord extending away from said second mounting block, said second two-wired power cord having a second two-wired male connector electrically connected to a distal end of said second two-wired power cord, said second two-wired male connector constructed and arranged for interlitment with said first two-wired female connector formed in said first mounting block; said second two-wired male connector including an internally threaded collar surrounding the second two-wired power cord and the second two-wired male connector; a second pair of wires electrically connected to a second two-wired electrical light in said second light fixture; a second two-wired female connector formed in said_second mounting block and electrically connected to said second pair of wires and said second two-wired power cord; said second female connector being surrounded by an externally threaded housing; whereby threadable connection of said main two-wired female connector formed in said power source with said first two-wired male connector will provide electrical power to said first two-wired electrical light and threadable connection of said first two-wired female connector with said second two-wired male connector will provide electrical power to said second two-wired electrical light. 3. The set of outdoor lights as defined in claim 2 wherein said two-wired electrical power source is a transformer. 4. The set of outdoor lights as defined in claim 2 wherein said two-wired electrical power source is a set of solar panels. 5. A method for creating a set of outdoor lights compromising the steps of: forming a two-wired female electrical connector surrounded by external threads in a power source; mounting a first light fixture assembly to said power source, wherein said first light fixture assembly includes a first mounting block affixed therein, said first mounting block including a first power cord extending away from said first mounting block, said first power cord having a first two-wired male connector electrically connected to a distal end of said first power cord, said first two-wired male connector constructed and arranged for interlitment with said two-wired female connector formed in said power source; said first two-wired male connector including an first internally threaded collar surrounding the first power cord and the first two-wired male connector; a first pair of wires electrically connected to a first two-wired electrical light in said first light fixture: a first two-wired female connector formed in said first mounting block and electrically connected to said first pair of wires and said first power cord; said first female connector being surrounded by an externally threaded housing; whereby said mounting first light fixture assembly to said power source step includes inserting said first two-wired male connector into said two-wired female connector formed in said power source and rotatively coupling said first threaded collar with said external threads surrounding said two-wired female connector formed in said power source mounting a second light fixture assembly to said first light fixture assembly, wherein said second light fixture assembly includes a second mounting block affixed therein, said second mounting block including a second power cord extending away from said second mounting block, said second power cord having a second two-wired male connector electrically connected to a distal end of said second power cord, said second two-wired male connector constructed and arranged for interfitment with said first two-wired female connector; said second two-wired male connector including an second internally threaded collar surrounding the second power cord and the second two-wired male connector: a second pair of wires electrically connected to a second two-wired electrical light in said second light fixture; a second two-wired female connector formed in said second mounting block and electrically connected to said second pair of wires and said second power cord: said second female connector being surrounded by an externally threaded housing; whereby said mounting second light fixture assembly to said first light fixture assembly step includes inserting said second two-wired male connector into said first two-wired female connector and rotatively coupling said second threaded collar with said externally threaded housing surrounding said first two-wired female connector formed. 6. The set of outdoor lights as defined in claim 2 further including an extender power cord section having a third two-wired female connector surrounded by external threads on one end and a third two-wired male connector surrounded by an internally threaded collar on the opposite end, whereby said third two-wired male connector is constructed and arranged for interfitment with said main, first or second two-wired female connector; and said third two-wired female connector is constructed and arranged for interfitment with said main, first or second two-wired male connector. 7. The set of outdoor lights as delined in claim 2 wherein first and second light fixtures each include a ground engaging stake affixed to said respective mounting block. 8. The method as defined in claim 5 wherein said power source is house current passing through a transformer. 9. The method as defined in claim 5 wherein said power source is a set of solar panels.
