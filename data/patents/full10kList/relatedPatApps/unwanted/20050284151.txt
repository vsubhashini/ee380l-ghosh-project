The present invention discloses a solar water cooler, which includes a water tank, a condensing panel, and an auxiliary refrigerating devices, wherein the water tank has an insulating panel transversely embedded into the water tank for separating the water tank into an upper cooling chamber and a lower chilling chamber, a pair of inner conduits for respectively communicating the cooling chamber to the chilling chamber, each of the cooling chamber and the chilling chamber has a water inlet port and a water outlet port, a plurality of conduits for respectively communicating the water tank to the condensing panel and the auxiliary refrigerating devices, wherein the auxiliary refrigerating device electrically powered by solar cells and by thermocells.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar water cooler, comprising: a water tank for reserving a predetermined volume of water; an insulating panel transversely embedded into said water tank for separating said water tank into an upper cooling chamber and a lower chilling chamber; a pair of inner conduits for respectively communicating a lower portion and a upper portion of said cooling chamber to a counterpart lower portion and a counterpart upper portion of said chilling chamber, wherein each of said cooling chamber and said chilling chamber has a water inlet port defined on an upper side wall and a water outlet port defined on a lower said wall; a condensing panel disposed above said cooling chamber and is mounted against an outer wall of a building to be integrally formed with said building, wherein said condensing panel comprises a radiating manifold and a plurality of radiating fins provided thereon, and an exposing opening defined on said radiating manifold for communicating said radiating manifold to outside; a pair of condensing conduit for correspondingly communicating a upper portion and a lower portion of said condensing panel to respective upper portion and lower portion of said cooling chamber; and an auxiliary refrigerating device disposed above said chilling chamber, wherein said auxiliary refrigerating device comprises a thermopile refrigerating unit and a temperature monitor unit, said thermopile refrigerating unit has a chilled water conduit respectively for communicating said upper portion and said lower portion of said chilling chamber. 2. The solar water cooler, as recited in claim 1, wherein said water tank is made of building material, or prepared in such a manner that the water tank comprises an inner flask made of stainless steel, an insulating layer made of foam plastic, and an outer casing made of aluminum plate; 3. The solar water cooler, as recited in claim 1, wherein a reflux pump coupled to said chilling chamber water inlet port for ensuring a chilled water be circularly serviced; 4. The solar water cooler, as recited in claim 1, wherein said auxiliary refrigerating unit is electrically powered by solar cells or by thermocells.
