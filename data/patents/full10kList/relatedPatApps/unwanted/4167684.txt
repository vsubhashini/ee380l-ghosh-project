The magnetic torque multiplier consists of two basic components --one large flat wheel containing two opposite and off-set pole series of equally spaced rare earth/cobalt permanent magnets. The top series of permanent magnets--(N), are attractors, while the lower series--(S) are repellers, relative to corresponding magnet segments on the driving rotor. The second component is the driving helical magnetic path rotor which has an "hourglass" or matching contour configuration with identical rare earth/cobalt permanent magnets equally spaced in a peripheral helical pattern around the driving rotor. Both the driving rotor and driven wheel must be made of non-magnetic material, preferably aluminum and arranged as a non-contacting/-zero friction mechanical worm and worm wheel. A useful torque multiplication occurs at the wheel output shaft relative to the driving rotor input shaft, well above the normal torque step-up ratio--between the two components.
