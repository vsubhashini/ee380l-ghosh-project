A solar-powered heat tape system for gas well regulators and other remotely located equipment is herein disclosed. The system comprises a solar power panel mounted atop a mast which provides electrical power to a rechargeable battery system through a charge controller. The output power of the battery is then routed through an AC power inverter. The AC power is then routed to a length of electrical heat tape that is used the keep gas regulators and other equipment from freezing during cold weather. All major electrical components with the exception of the solar panel and the heat tape are contained in a weatherproof and lockable electrical cabinet. The system thus provides electrical power at remote locations to protect plumbing, miscellaneous equipment, testing equipment, telemetry equipment, and the like from freezing.
