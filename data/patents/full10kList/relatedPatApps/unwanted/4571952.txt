A solar and convection assisted heat pump for a building includes an oversized outdoor coil having a surface area at least thirty times greater than the surface area of the indoor coil. Additionally, the outdoor coil is mounted to maximize simultaneous exposure to the sun, exposure to the prevailing wind flow, and natural convective air flow over the panel heat exchanger.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In an improved solar and convection assisted heating and cooling reversible heat pump system for a building of the type including a coil outside of the building for energy transfer and a coil inside of the building for energy transfer, the improvement comprising: an outside coil having an effective surface area oversized relative to the surface area of the inside coil in a ratio of at least 30 to 1, the outside coil comprising a black body the tube forming an outside panel through which air may flow and upon which light may radiate; and mounting means for maintaining the outside panel oriented (a) distant from other structure so that both sides of the panel are within, and somewhat transverse to, an unobstructed path of prevailing region air flow, (b) with both sides of the panel open to air flow through the panel, (c) with one side of the panel oriented for solar energy incidence, and (d) in position to maximize heat transfer due to the simultaneous effects of (1) prevailing region air flow through the panel, (2) natural convection air flow around and through the panel, (3) moisture evaporation and condensation, and (4) radiant energy incidence of the panel wherein the panel position is a combination of a direction transverse to the prevailing region air flow, a horizontal position for maximum natural convection and evaporation and condensation energy transfer, and a direction transverse to the incidence of solar energy. 2. The system of claim 1 wherein the surface area ratio is in the range of 50-60 to 1. 3. The system of claim 2 or 1 wherein the mounting means includes a mounting bracket surrounding the periphery of the outside coil to prevent obstruction of the path of prevailing region air flow through the outside coil.
