A modular solar heat controller contains four chambers through which heated air is deflected to an area of need, such as a house or building. One of the chambers contains a conventional air blower while the remaining three chambers are connected by ductwork to the building as well as a solar heat collector and solar storage unit respectively. Each of the four chambers, which are arranged in quadrants, is open to the next adjacent two chambers, making a total of three passageways through each chamber, except the chamber containing the blower, which does not connect to the outside and therefore has only two passageways. Two of the three passageway type chambers have control cylinders adapted to selectively close one of two predetermined passageways within the chamber permitting flow through the chamber by the other two passageways. In this manner the controller acts in three separate modes. In the first mode it can funnel air from the collector through the blower to the building. In the second mode heated air is transported from the collector through the blower past a heat exchanger to storage for later use. And in the third mode heat from storage is channeled through the blower to the area to be heated.
Claims What I claim is: 1. A control device for a solar heating system having a heat collector and a storage unit, the solar heating system being operative on a building structure, said control device comprising in combination: a. a control module generally divided by partitions into four chambers including: a collector chamber having a port establishing air flow communication between the collector chamber and said collector; a building chamber having a port establishing communication between the building chamber and said building; a blower chamber having two separate passageways, one establishing communication between the blower chamber and the collector chamber and the other establishing communication between the blower chamber and the building chamber; a storage chamber having a port establishing communication between the storage chamber and said storage unit, said storage chamber also having two separate passageways, one passageway establishing communication between the storage chamber and the collector chamber and the other establishing communication between the storage chamber and the building chamber; b. a blower mounted within said blower chamber; c. a generally cylindrical hollow collector air flow controller in said collector chamber having a cylindrical wall, an end cap and an open base port, said base port being in communication with said passageway between the collector chamber and the blower chamber, a portion of the cylindrical wall being removed to form an open side and a deflector side, means for pivotally mounting said collector controller for pivotal movement about its longitudinal axis, said collector controller being movable between a first position wherein said deflector side blocks air flow communication between the collector chamber and the collector and the open side allows air flow from said storage unit via said storage chamber and the open side and the open base into said blower chamber, and a second position wherein said deflector side blocks air flow communication between said collector chamber and said storage chamber and allows air flow from said collector through said collector chamber into said blower chamber; d. a generally cylindrical blower air flow controller in said blower chamber having a cylindrical wall having an end cap on either end, a portion of the cylindrical wall being removed to form an open side and a deflector side, means for pivotally mounting said blower controller for pivotal movement about its longitudinal axis, said blower air flow controller being movable between a first position wherein said deflector side blocks air flow communication between said building chamber and said building and the open side allows air flow from said collector via said collector chamber into said blower chamber and said storage chamber into said storage unit, and a second position wherein said deflector side blocks air flow communication between said building chamber and said storage chamber and allows air flow from said collector through said collector chamber and said blower chamber into said building; and e. means for alternatively positioning said collector and blower air flow controllers to form a first flow path from the collector to the building, a second flow path from the collector to the storage unit and a third flow path from the storage unit to the building.
