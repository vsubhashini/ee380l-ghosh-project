A solar heat collector for use with a solar heating system, the solar heat collector being composed of a heat absorbing structure, a heat transmitting panel, a housing within which the heat absorbing structure is supported and further including a device for mounting the panel, and a conduit for trapping and conveying away liquid leaking past the panel.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a solar heat collector for use in a solar heating system, including: a heat absorbing structure; a heat transmitting panel; a housing within which the heat absorbing structure is supported, the housing including means for mounting the panel thereon in a spaced relation relative to the heat absorbing structure, the mounting means and the panel together defining an exteriorly exposed interface; and wherein the improvement relates to the panel mounting means which comprises: a plurality of mounting brackets each of which extend along and engage one side of the heat transmitting panel to support that side, wherein each mounting bracket is unitarily formed from one piece of material and has a cross-sectional configuration which defines two open ended loops that point in opposed direction, wherein one loop is sized to frictionally engage a portion of the housing to attach the bracket to the housing, wherein the other loop is located generally beneath an edge of the panel to form a moisture carrying conduit which conveys away any moisture which leaks past the exteriorly exposed interface, wherein the heat transmitting panel is supported along one side on an upwardly facing portion of said one loop of said mounting bracket on that side, wherein said mounting brackets are connected together at their ends such that the moisture carrying conduits communicate with one another and extend around the periphery of the heat transmitting panel, and further including at least one aperture located in one of the moisture carrying conduits such that said leaked fluid may drain by the force of gravity therefrom. 2. A solar collector according to claim 1 wherein said conduit of each mounting bracket has a generally U-shaped cross-section. 3. A solar collector according to claim 1 wherein said housing includes a base frame to support said mounting means and said base frame having a plurality of planar vertical edges which extend upwardly and on which said one loop of each of said mounting brackets is respectively frictionally engaged. 4. A solar collector according to claim 1, wherein each of said mounting brackets has a generally S-shaped cross-section to define said two loops. 5. A solar heat collector for use in a solar heating system, comprising: a heat absorbing tank having an inlet pipe and an outlet pipe; a heat transmitting panel; a base frame within which said tank is supported; a mounting structure to support said panel on said base frame spaced above said tank, said mounting structure comprising a plurality of unitary mounting brackets corresponding to the number of sides of the panel with each mounting bracket being located respectively along one side of said panel, each of said mounting brackets having a generally S-shaped cross-section which defines an outside loop and an inside loop, said outside loop having an outer leg engaging against an adjacent edge of one side of said panel and extending up above said panel so as to define an exteriorly exposed interface, said inside loop being sized to frictionally engage a portion of said base frame, said inside loop further having a portion which abuts against a face of said panel to support said panel thereon; and wherein a generally U-shaped conduit is formed by said outside loop located beneath the adjacent edges of said panel for trapping and conveying away liquid leaking past said exposed interface, and wherein said mounting brackets are interconnected at their ends, and said conduit includes at least one drain hole through which said leaked liquid may drain.
