Heat flux sensors respectively painted black and white and mounted to a passive solar energy window intercept solar radiation and change the temperature of part of the window. The sensors, and differentially connected thermocouples attached to them, couple data to an electronic computer by which the solar radiation, reradiation, and conduction/convection thermal loss through the undisturbed balance of the window can be deduced. The computer outputs the net energy transfer NET to a recorder, a two-state indicator, and a window insulation control unit. The circuitry of the control unit responds to an ordinary thermostat and the NET from the computer to produce a condition signal, senses the position of the insulation, and repositions the insulation when necessary in response to the condition signal. The insulation is moved to block the window when the direction of NET is into the building and the inside temperature is higher than the thermostat limit temperature, and when the direction of NET is outward and the inside temperature is lower than the thermostat limit temperature.
