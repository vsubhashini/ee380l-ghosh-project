A freeze protection system allows the working fluid contained in the communicating tubes of the solar collector to drain from both the input and output tubes of the collector when a first predetermined temperature of the working fluid is detected and to fill the collector via both the input and output tubes when a second predetermined temperature is detected. The invention includes valve mechanisms, of the spool valve variety, that communicate the working fluid to be heated to the collector and therefrom to a storage tank, a valve actuator and a sensor. The actuator moves a valve element from a first position for communicating working fluid to be heated from a source to the input tube of the collector and for communicating heated working fluid from the output tube of the collector to a storage facility to a second position for interrupting fluid communication from the source to the collector and for communicating both the input and output tubes of the collector to a drainpipe--draining the collector of working fluid--when the first predetermined temperature level is detected by the sensor. Upon detection of the second predetermined temperature level the sensor causes the actuator to return the valve element to the first position via an intermediate position that closes the drainpipe and temporarily communicates the working fluid to both the input and output tubes of the collector.
