An arrangement is provided for modifying video signals so that the displayed image along a first directional axis has its dimensions changed relative to another directional axis perpendicular to the first axis. An illustrative system application of this arrangement is in the commercial television broadcasting of anamorphically recorded motion picture film program material. The arrangement utilizes electronic gating of a pair of analog line delays for each of the primary transmission colors to store the selected portion of each video line which corresponds to the portion of the motion picture scene used for the television scene. The stored portions of the lines are stretched to full line length by reading them out of the line delays at a slower rate thereby providing a television signal indicative of a image in true proportion. A controller provides various operating modes for changing the timing of the gating such that the selected portions of the video lines corresponds to different positions along the video lines to effect electronic panning of the motion picture scene. The utilization of a computer or a recording device in the illustrative system enhances performance and versatility.
