(1) A light radiation stand for holding a fiber optic cable which transmits light rays therethrough and emits the same from its light-emitting end is described. The light radiation stand has a pole removably mounted to the stand and a mirror rotatably mounted on said pole. The mirror has a concave surface on one side and a convex surface on the other side. Furthermore a plane mirror is rotatably mounted on the middle portion of the pole.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A light radiation stand comprising a stand base, holding means mounted on said stand base, fiber optic cable means for transmitting solar rays, said holding means holding said cable means on said stand base such that light rays emitted from said cable means are directed in a desired direction, an elongated pole, mounting means removably mounting said pole on said stand base, said elongated pole having a longitudinal axis and an outer end, first mirror means rotatably mounted on said outer end of said pole for rotation about a rotary axis coincident with said longitudinal axis of said pole, said first mirror means having two sides, one of said sides being a concave mirror surface, the other of said sides being a convex mirror surface, a second mirror means, and support means supporting said second mirror means on said pole between said outer end of said pole and said mounting means, said second mirror means being mounted on said pole for rotation about said longitudinal axis.
