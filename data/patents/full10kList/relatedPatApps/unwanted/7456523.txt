In a power generation system which includes a plurality of sets of direct current power sources and power converters which are connected to the direct current power sources to convert a direct current power into an alternating current power, the power converters being connected in parallel to supply the alternating current power to a system power supply, from the plurality of power converters in the system, one power converter is set as a master machine which detects an islanding operation state in which power supply from the system power supply is stopped, and setting is executed so as to cause the remaining power converters not to detect the islanding operation state. When the master machine is not present among the power converters in operation, the master machine is selected from the power converters in operation in accordance with a predetermined condition.
