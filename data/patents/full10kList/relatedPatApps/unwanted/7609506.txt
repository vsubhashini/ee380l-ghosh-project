A multimedia player is used in conjunction with a grave marker to pay tribute to a decedent. A main body portion of the player supports an opaque solar panel portion that also provides a barrier protecting a video screen on the main body portion of the multimedia player from sunlight damage. The solar panel is hinged as a door over the screen and has a wireless interface to a memory card player of the main body portion. The solar panel provides a recharging voltage via the wireless interface to the electronics module to recharge a lithium ion battery that powers the multimedia player. A flash memory reader contains the tribute on a memory card of any format.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a self-contained multimedia player suited for attachment to a grave marker and suited for playing a predefined audio and video presentation relating to a decedent, the self-contained multimedia player comprising: a housing carrying a memory device storing said predefined presentation; a multimedia player means in operative communication with said memory device for reading the memory device and playing the presentation; a display screen carried on a front face of the housing in operative communication with the multimedia player means for receiving and displaying a video portion of the presentation; in combination, a rechargeable battery in electrical communication with the multimedia player for operating the player to play the presentation, and a solar panel external of the housing, connectable through the housing to said rechargeable battery for supplying current to recharge the battery, and means pivotally mounting said solar panel to the housing at a first lateral edge of the solar panel for selected movement between a closed position wherein a back side of the solar panel overlies said display screen for protecting the display screen from exposure to light while displaying an active front face of the solar panel for receiving light to generate electricity, and an open position uncovering the display screen and thereby permitting viewing the screen; a resilient seal carried by said back face of the solar panel in position sealing against the housing and protecting the display screen when the solar panel is in said closed position; a first pair of contacts mounted on the front face of the housing; a second pair of contacts mounted on the backside of the solar panel, wherein when the solar panel is in the closed position the first and second pair of contacts align and electrically connect the solar panel to the rechargeable battery and the multimedia player is disabled from playing said presentation; and a latch having a first latch portion carried by the housing and a second latch portion carried by the solar panel at a second lateral edge thereof opposite from said first lateral edge of said solar panel, wherein the first and second latch portions are suitably positioned to mate when the solar panel is moved to the closed position, to secure the solar panel in the closed position with respect to the housing. 2. The multimedia player of claim 1, wherein said housing further comprises: a system of first and second complimentary seals for protecting said display screen, wherein said first seal is said resilient seal, and said second seal is a peripheral shield wall extending forward from the position of said display screen at the periphery of said solar panel when in closed position to protect both the first seal and the display screen. 3. The multimedia player of claim 1, wherein said housing further comprises: a shield wall peripheral to said resilient seal, extending forward from the position of said display screen and juxtaposed to the periphery of said solar panel in closed position; wherein said shield wall includes at least a top edge wall and a pair of opposed side edge walls with an open bottom portion, wherein one of said pair said side edge walls is juxtaposed to said first latch portion, and wherein said top and side edge walls provide, in combination with said housing and the solar panel in closed position, a labyrinth seal at top and side edges of the display screen for protecting both the display screen and the resilient seal and permitting bottom drainage; the shield wall is configured to define a cutout area in said side edge wall juxtaposed to said first latch portion; and said second latch portion is configured and positioned to substantially close said cutout area when the solar panel is in said closed position, maintaining the integrity of the shield wall seal when the solar panel is latched in the closed position. 4. The multimedia player of claim 1, wherein said self-contained multimedia player means comprises: said first contacts located on said housing and said second contacts located on said solar panel, said first and second contacts being positioned such that they are out of electrical communication when said solar panel is in said open position; and further comprising: means for maintaining said solar panel and housing in alignment for bringing said first and second contacts into electrical communication with the solar panel is moved to said closed position.
