A doghouse having an heating and air conditioning unit installed therein with insulated walls, an insulated roof, hinges connecting the roof on one of its sides to the upright walls for easy access by the pet owner to the controls of the heating and air conditioning unit. The present invention also has a flexible door covering with laterally overlapping parallel strips that are made from a heavy material so as to be minimally affected by tangling and frequent wind interaction. The strips are vertically hung from the upper part of the door opening to allow pets freedom of access in and out of the doghouse, while at the same time retaining the major portion of the climate controlled air within the insulated walls and roof of the doghouse during pet use.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A pet shelter which has an interior that is climate controlled for the comfort of pets therein during times of outdoor temperatures extremes, said pet shelter comprising a floor; a plurality of walls each having an upper portion, one of said walls having a door opening therethrough; a roof having opposite sides; said walls upwardly depending from said floor; said roof supported by said walls; said floor, said roof, and said walls being made from insulated materials that are easily washable, said materials also being resistant to solar radiation and exposure to temperature extremes; a plurality of hinges, each of said hinges being connected between one of said opposite sides of said roof and one of said walls so that the other of said opposite sides of said roof is movable between a closed position and opened positions; an air conditioning and heating unit positioned through said upper portion of one of said walls so as to minimize contact between a pet placed within said pet shelter and said air conditioning and heating unit; said pet shelter also comprising a connection means for connecting said air conditioning and heating unit to a remote power source; and a door covering made from a plurality of strips of material having opposed ends, one of said opposed ends being hung from the one of said walls having said door opening and hung in positions to laterally overlap one another so that said strips completely cover the width of said door opening, the other end of each of said strips hanging downwardly so as to completely cover the length of said door opening, said strips each having sufficient weight so as not to become tangled as a result of movement therethrough of pets and not to be frequently disturbed by winds for a maximum retention within said pet shelter of air that has been moderated in temperature by said air conditioning and heating unit. 2. The pet shelter of claim 1 further comprising a rectangular configuration and a plurality of windows, each of said windows being positioned through one of said walls. 3. The pet shelter of claim 1 wherein said air conditioning and heating unit has a plurality of thermostatic controls, and wherein said thermostatic controls are positioned within said roof and walls to minimize interference by young children. 4. The pet shelter of claim 1 wherein said strips are made from transparent material. 5. A pet shelter which has an interior that is climate controlled for the comfort of pets therein during times of outdoor temperatures extremes, said pet shelter comprising a floor; a plurality of walls each having an upper portion, one of said walls having a door opening therethrough; a roof having opposite sides; said walls upwardly depending from said floor; said roof supported by said walls; said floor, said roof, and said walls being made from insulated materials that are easily washable, said materials also being resistant to solar radiation and exposure to temperature extremes; a plurality of hinges, each of said hinges being connected between one of said opposite sides of said roof and one of said walls so that the other of said opposite sides of said roof is movable between a closed position and opened positions; an air conditioning and heating unit positioned through said upper portion of one of said walls so as to minimize contact between a pet placed within said pet shelter and said air conditioning and heating unit; said pet shelter also comprising a connection means for connecting said air conditioning and heating unit to a remote power source; and a door covering made from a plurality of strips of transparent material having opposed ends, one of said opposed ends being hung from the one of said walls having said door opening and hung in positions to laterally overlap one another so that said strips completely cover the width of said door opening, the other end of each of said strips hanging downwardly so as to completely cover the length of said door opening, said strips each having sufficient weight so as not to become tangled as a result of movement therethrough of pets and not to be frequently disturbed by winds for a maximum retention within said pet shelter of air that has been moderated in temperature by said air conditioning and heating unit. 6. The pet shelter of claim 5 further comprising a remote control box connected to said air conditioning and heating unit and a quantity of wiring connecting said remote control box to said air conditioning and heating unit, said remote control box having a temperature display means so that a person can remotely monitor temperatures within said pet shelter and adjust them accordingly. 7. The pet shelter of claim 5 wherein said walls have an outside surface and further comprising a temperature display means positioned on said outside surface of one of said walls so that a person can monitor temperatures within said pet shelter without having to open said roof.
