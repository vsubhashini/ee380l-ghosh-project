A measuring system for measuring real time groundwater data and graphically depicting the data for analysis and interpretation is disclosed. At least one transducer is positioned in a well to be modeled. A control unit is provided to acquire data from the transducer and to store the data acquired. A home base unit is provided to receive data from the control unit. The home base unit contains a geographic information system program for processing the data. A display unit is connected to the home base unit for displaying the data received.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A measuring system for measuring real time groundwater data from a plurality of wells and graphically depicting the data, the system comprising: a plurality of transducers for placement in the plurality of wells, wherein at least one transducer is placed below the water table in each well; a plurality of remote terminal units for collecting data from the transducers, wherein one remote terminal unit is positioned proximate each well and wherein each remote terminal unit is electrically connected to the at least one transducer in its corresponding well and wherein each remote terminal unit contains a radio frequency transmitter and receiver; a plurality of central terminal units for remotely collecting, reducing and processing data from the plurality of remote terminal units wherein a single centraI terminal unit services a group of remote terminal units, and wherein each single central terminal unit is positioned substantially central to, but remote from, the corresponding group of remote terminal units, wherein the plurality of central terminal units contain a radio frequency transmitter and receiver for communication with the plurality of remote terminal units, and wherein the plurality of central terminal units contain a remote telecommunications unit; a home base unit containing a geographic information system for compiling, storing, manipulating and outputting mapped data, the home base unit being remote from the plurality of central terminal units and wherein the home base unit contains a remote telecommunications unit for communicating with the remote telecommunications unit of the plurality of central terminal units; and a display unit connected to the home base unit for displaying the mapped data output from the home base unit in real time. 2. The system as in claim 1 wherein the remote terminal units are solar powered. 3. The system as in claim 1 wherein the display unit displays the data in three dimensions. 4. A method of measuring real time groundwater data of an area having a plurality of wells and graphically depicting the data with a system containing at least one transducer in each well, a plurality of remote terminal units electrically connected to the at least one transducer in its corresponding well and wherein each remote terminal unit contains a radio frequency transmitter and receiver, a plurality of central terminal units wherein a single central terminal unit services a group of remote terminal units, and wherein each single central terminal unit is positioned substantially central to, but remote from, the corresponding group of remote terminal units, wherein the plurality of central terminal units contain a radio frequency transmitter and receiver, and wherein the plurality of central terminal units contain a remote telecommunications unit, a home base unit containing a geographic information system and a remote telecommunications unit, and a display unit connected to the home base unit, the method including the steps of: establishing a plurality of monitoring wells having a transducer in each well for measuring well data and providing a signal representation thereof; using the plurality of remote terminal units to collect the data from the transducers; transmitting the data collected by the plurality of remote terminal units from the remote terminal units to the plurality of central terminal units via the radio frequency transmitters of the remote terminal units; using the radio frequency receivers of the plurality of central terminal units to receive the data transmitted by the plurality of remote terminal units; processing the data in the plurality of central terminal units to eliminate unwanted data; transmitting the processed data from the plurality of central terminal units to the home base unit via the remote telecommunication units of the plurality of central terminal units; using the remote telecommunication unit of the home base unit to receive the processed data from the central terminal units; interpolating the processed data in the home base unit to obtain parameter values for an area of groundwater locations; obtaining a real time representation of the groundwater surface; and displaying the obtained real time representation on the display unit.
