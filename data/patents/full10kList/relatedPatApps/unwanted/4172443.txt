A solar collector having a central radiation receiver and a plurality of mirrors mounted on articulated mounting structures arranged over a surface in an array pattern comprised of discrete paths, with the path shapes having certain prescribed symmetry properties. Using mathematical properties of tilt angle components expressed relative to fixed orthogonal axes of resolution for mirrors oriented to reflect solar radiation onto the radiation receiver, mirror control is accomplished by the use of coupling devices which extend along the discrete mirror containing paths. Each coupling device comprises a passive linear series system having an appropriate gradient of component values. The types of linear series coupling devices specifically considered in the disclosure are tensile elastic coupling devices and electrically resistive coupling devices for mirror control in large scale collectors, and torsional elastic coupling devices for mirror control in small scale collectors. Direct use of the coupled control information requires the use of unconventional mirror mounts which structurally incorporate the fixed orthogonal axes of resolution as mirror mount axes. The mirrors for large scale collectors are mounted on individual mirror mount structures, and appropriate mirror array patterns may be established on any reasonably smooth terrain. The torsional coupling devices intended for use in small scale collectors are used as structural members in a collective mounting structure for the mirrors as well as serving to couple tilt angle information along the individual coupling devices.
