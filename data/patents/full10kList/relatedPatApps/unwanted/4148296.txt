Solar heating apparatus comprising units that can be assembled on roofs and outer side walls of buildings easily to give the buildings an aesthetic beauty.
Claims I claim: 1. Solar heating apparatus for heating fluid by solar rays comprising clear plastic members having semi-hemispherical, double-walled upper parts for receiving the transmission of solar rays, a substantially rectangular lower part having flanges extending therefrom for mounting and interconnecting said apparatus to abutting apparatus, a black metal pipe located within said apparatus so as to receive heat from said solar rays, said black metal pipe storing and transmitting said fluid to be heated by solar rays, and end means for supporting said metal pipe and interconnecting said apparatus to abutting apparatus. 2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said clear plastic essentially consists of acrylic. 3. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said clear plastic essentially consists of poly-carbonate. 4. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said semi-hemispherical double-walled upper parts comprise vacuum means. 5. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said flanges extend longitudinally along the sides of said apparatus. 6. Solar heating apparatus for heating fluids comprising a plurality of clear plastic extruded members, each of said members having a semi-hemispherical, double walled section for the transmission of solar rays, a substantially flat section opposite said semi-hemispherical surfaces, means for mounting and interconnecting said clear plastic members to form solar heating assembly, a plurality of black metal pipes for containing and transmitting said fluids positioned within said apparatus along a central longitudinal axis and means for supporting and interconnecting said apparatus.
