A system for automatically and periodically applying moisture to curing concrete that can be transported from one location to another is provided. A portable concrete curing unit receives water from a water source and distributes such water to a moisture applicator that is situated near a curing concrete object. The moisture applicator applies moisture to the curing concrete so as to maintain the concrete object at a desired moisture level during the curing process. The concrete curing unit may contain a power source, a pump, and a controller. The controller is connected to the pump such that the pump will distribute water to the moisture applicator during an activation period. This timing function of the controller allows for a system and method of automatically and periodically curing concrete that can be controlled by the user without extensive need for manual labor during the concrete curing process.
