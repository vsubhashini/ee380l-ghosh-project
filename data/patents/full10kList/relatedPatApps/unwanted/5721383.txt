A flow meter system and method includes detecting the movement of a substance through a conduit with a sensing device partially within the path of flow of the substance. A signal indicative of the quantity of the substance moving through the conduit is generated in response to the detection of the movement of the substance. Another signal indicative of the cumulative quantity of the substance is generated from the quantity signal. Cumulative quantity information is transmitted in a wireless manner, and is received at a remote location.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A sub-metering flow meter system for measuring the quantity of a fluid moving through a conduit to a toilet, the conduit having an opening therein, comprising: a shut off valve connected in fluid communication with the conduit to control the flow of fluid to the toilet; sensing means for mounting to the conduit adjacent to the shut off valve and extending only partially through the opening into the path of flow of the fluid for detecting movement of the fluid through the conduit to the toilet to generate a quantity signal indicative of the quantity of the fluid moving therepast; counter means responsive to said quantity signal for generating a cumulative quantity signal indicative of a cumulative quantity of fluid moving past said sensing means; communication means responsive to the cumulative quantity signal for transmitting cumulative quantity information; receiver means positioned remotely from said communication means for receiving said cumulative quantity information at a remote location; said sensing means including a housing means being mounted substantially entirely outside of said conduit and enclosing substantially the conduit opening for securing said sensing means to the conduit in a fluid tight manner, said sensing means further including a revolvable paddle wheel disposed within said housing means and extending partially through the opening for contacting the fluid to facilitate the generation of said quantity signal, and said sensing means further including a signal generating means disposed within said housing means for cooperating with said paddle wheel to generate said quantity signal for quantifying the amount of the fluid moving through the conduit; said signal generating means including a magnetically activated switch for generating electrical pulses; said revolvable paddle wheel having a plurality of blades extending radially from a hub, at least one of said blades including a magnet disposed therein for cooperating with said magnetically activated switch to produce a series of said electrical pulses defining said cumulative quantity signal when said paddle wheel is rotated by the fluid moving thereby, wherein the radial length X of the blades is dimensioned relative to the diameter Y of the conduit; said housing means including support means therewithin for enabling said paddle wheel to extend partially through the conduit opening in a slightly intrusive manner to contact the fluid, wherein said hub is positioned at approximately the opening to permit said blades to extend through the opening and into, the conduit to greatly reduce disruption of the flow of the fluid; and wherein the minimum penetration ratio of the relative dimensions of the conduit opening and the blades is equal to the radial length X of the paddle wheel blades divided by the diameter Y of the conduit, and the maximum penetration ratio being equal to the radial length X divided by the diameter Y of the conduit to enable the blades to penetrate the fluid flowing within the interior of the conduit in a slightly intrusive manner to contact outermost layers of the flowing fluid to disrupt the flow thereof minimally, wherein said minimum penetration ratio is approximately 3/32 and said maximum penetration ratio is approximately 3/8; wherein the diameter of the conduit opening is substantially equal to twice the radial length of the paddle wheel blades; whereby accurate measurements of flow to the toilet are facilitated. 2. A sub-metering flow meter system according to claim 1, wherein said housing means further includes a yoke having an opening therethrough and another yoke coupled releasably to one another for facilitating the fluid tight engagement of said housing means with the conduit on opposite sides thereof, said support means being received within the yoke opening, and said support means including a pair of spaced apart walls extending into the conduit opening to define a chamber to receive and to support rotatably said paddle wheel therein. 3. A sub-metering flow meter system according to claim 2, wherein said cumulative quantity signal generated by said counter means is indicative of the number of said electrical pulses produced by said magnetically activated switch. 4. A sub-metering flow meter system according to claim 3, wherein said communication means includes a transmitter means coupled to said counter means for transmitting said information to said receiving means. 5. A sub-metering flow meter system according to claim 4, wherein said communications means further includes a photovoltaic cell coupled to said counter means and said transmitter means. 6. A sub-metering flow meter according to claim 2, further including securing means for releasably coupling said yoke and said another yoke to one another for enabling said sensing means to be mounted to said conduit. 7. A method for measuring the quantity of a fluid moving through a conduit to a toilet, the conduit having an opening therein, comprising: connecting said conduit in fluid communication with a shut off valve to control the flow of fluid to the toilet; using a sensing means for mounting to the conduit adjacent to the shut off valve and including a paddle wheel having a plurality of blades radiating outwardly from a hub, and further including support means for rotatably supporting said paddle wheel; detecting movement of the fluid through the conduit and generating in response thereto, a quantity signal indicative of the quantity of the fluid moving therepast to determine water usage by the toilet; generating a cumulative quantity signal indicative of the cumulative quantity of the fluid moving therepast; transmitting cumulative quantity information in response to said cumulative quantity signal; receiving said cumulative quantity information at a remote location; positioning said support means outside of the conduit over the opening therein to enable said paddle wheel to extend partially through the opening in a slightly intrusive manner to contact the fluid with minimal disruption of the flow of the substance; positioning said hub at approximately the opening; and dimensioning the radial length of the blades relative to the diameter of the conduit to provide a minimum penetration ratio of the relative dimensions of the conduit opening and the blades, said minimum ratio being equal to the radial length X of the paddle wheel blades divided by the diameter Y of the conduit, and to provide a maximum penetration ratio equal to the radial length X divided by the diameter Y of the conduit to enable the blades to penetrate the fluid flowing within the interior of the conduit in a slightly intrusive manner to contact outermost layers of the flowing fluid to disrupt the flow thereof minimally, wherein said minimum penetration ratio is approximately 3/32 and said maximum penetration ratio is approximately 3/8; wherein the diameter of the conduit opening is substantially equal to twice the radial length of the paddle wheel blades; whereby accurate measurements of flow to the toilet are facilitated.
