Disclosed is a system to extract water moisture from the atmosphere, highly purify and condition the extracted water, and provide beverages for human consumption. In one embodiment, the device collects water-vapor condensation from filtered intake air, and then subjects the condensate to a series of purification filters and to a sterilization process in order to produce drinking water. The system may then use the water produced to provide carbonated drinks, flavored drinks, coffee drinks, or ice. The system may also play music and charge a portable electronic device. The disclosed system may incorporate the variations in different combinations.
