A solar energy reflector formed of a rigid frame that supports a thin reflective sheet and retains the sheet in a parabolic or like concave shape notwithstanding severe wind or like loads. The frame includes rigid end plates that define slots that have portions concentric with the focal axis of the parabolic surface so that the reflector can be installed onto and removed from a fixed water carrying pipe without disturbing the plumbing connections to the pipe. A drive system and solar energy sensor circuit connected thereto for assuring that the reflector is aimed at the sun throughout its traverse of the sky from dawn to dusk. A protective cover for the solar collector which both protects the highly reflective surface against deterioration and contributes to the overall strength of the collector.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar collector comprising first and second substantially identical rigid end plates which respectively define congruent convex edges and define in a portion remote from said edges a slot that has an arcuate portion concentric with the focus of the convex edge, said slots each having a linear portion extending from said arcuate portion to an edge of respective said end plates remote from said convex edges, first and second rigid elongate side pieces joined to respective said side edge portions and extending between said end plates to form a generally rectangular frame, a sheet of reflective material secured to said convex edges and said side pieces so as to form a concave surface intermediate said end plate and said side pieces, a rigid pipe extending through the slots in respective said end plates, support means exterior of said rectangular frame for immovably mounting said pipe, bushing means for rotatively supporting said end plates relative said rigid pipe so that said pipe coincides with the focus of the concave surface, a bushing retainer substantially coextensive with said linear slot portion and having a radiused portion cooperable with said arcuate portion to define a circular opening concentric with the focus of the concave sheet surface, said bushing means including a split bushing having an inner diameter corresponding to the outer diameter of said rigid pipe and an outer diameter corresponding to said circular opening, means for removably mounting said bushing retainer in said slot to afford installation and removal of said rectangular frame onto and from said rigid pipe without affecting the pipe, and means for pivoting said frame relative said pipe so that said concave surface tracks the sun throughout its traverse. 2. In a solar energy collector of the class including a reflective trough having a reflective surface of concave cross-sectional shape, a heat absorbing element supported at the focus of the reflective surface, said heat absorbing element being elongated along an axis and lying so that said axis is directed along a substantially north-south line, and means for rotatively driving the reflective surface only toward a westward pointing direction so to expose the reflective surface and the element to solar rays, the improvement comprising a photoelectric sensor mounted on said reflective surface proximate the vertex thereof, an opaque shield secured to said reflective surface laterally adjacent said sensor and extending substantially parallel to the axis of said reflective surface on the eastward side thereof, and means connecting said sensor to said driving means to activate said driving means when said sensor is not shaded by said shield or said heat absorbing element. 3. A solar collector comprising first and second substantially identical rigid end plates which respectively define congruent convex edges and define in a portion remote from said edges a slot that has an arcuate portion concentric with the focus of the convex edge, each said end plate having a pair of linear mutually parallel side edge portions flanking said convex edge, first and second rigid elongate side pieces having a width substantially equal to the length of said side edge portions and being joined to respective said side edge portions and extending between said end plates to form a generally rectangular frame, each said side piece having a flange perpendicular to said side edge portions and integral therewith for affording rigidity thereto, said flanges residing in a flat plane spaced from said convex edges by a distance greater than the spacing of said slot portion therefrom, a sheet of reflective material secured to said convex edges and said side pieces so as to form a concave surface intermediate said end plates and said side pieces, a rigid pipe extending through the slots in respective said end plates, bushing means for rotatively supporting said end plates relative said rigid pipe so that said pipe coincides with the focus of the concave surface, means for pivoting said frame relative said pipe including a unidirectional motor having a shaft and being mounted in spaced relation to said pipe and said collector, a crank arm secured to said shaft for rotation therewith, said crank arm having a distal end remote from said shaft, and an operating lever having a first end pinned to said distal end and a second end pinned directly to said end plate at a site remote from said bushing means, said operating lever being longer than said crank arm and being proportioned so that said collector pivots through an angle of approximately 120.degree. in response to full rotation of said motor shaft, and motor control means including a photosensor secured to said concave surface in proximity to the vertex of said surface so that said photosensor resides in the shadow of said rigid pipe when said concave surface is directed at the sun and means operatively connecting said photosensor to said motor for activating said motor in response to impingement of solar energy on said photosensor so that said rectangular frame is pivoted until the rigid pipe again shades the photosensor. 4. A solar collector according to claim 3 in combination with an opaque shield supported adjacent said photosensor and extending toward said pipe, said opaque shield being disposed laterally of said photosensor to shade said photosensor from rays passing the eastward side of said pipe so that said photosensor is excited only by solar rays passing the westward side of said pipe. 5. A solar collector comprising first and second substantially identical rigid end plates which respectively define congruent convex edges and define in a portion remote from said edges a slot that has an arcuate portion concentric with the focus of the convex edge, first and second rigid elongate side pieces joined to respective said side edge portions and extending between said end plates to form a generally rectangular frame, a sheet of reflective material secured to said convex edges and said side pieces so as to form a concave surface intermediate said end plate and said side pieces, a rigid pipe extending through the slots in respective said end plates, means for rotatively supporting said end plates relative said rigid pipe so that said pipe coincides with the focus of the concave surface, and means for pivoting said frame relative said pipe so that said concave surface tracks the sun throughout its traverse, said pivoting means including a unidirectional motor having a shaft and being mounted in spaced relation to said pipe and said collector so that said shaft is parallel to said pipe, a crank arm secured to said shaft for rotation therewith, said crank arm having a distal end remote from said shaft, and an operating lever having a first end pinned to said distal end and a second end pinned directly to said end plate at a site remote from said support means, said operating lever being longer than said crank arm so that in response to rotation of said shaft, said collector pivots through an angle less than 360.degree., said operating lever being mounted on the side of said crank arm opposite said motor shaft to permit said motor shaft to rotate 360.degree. in a single direction, and motor activating means responsive to misalignment between the sun and said concave surface for activating the motor in the single direction to move the concave surface into alignment with the sun. 6. A solar energy collector according to claim 5 wherein said motor activating means includes a photoelectric sensor mounted for movement with said concave surface and an opaque member mounted for cooperation with said sensor to effect lesser excitation of said sensor when said collector is in a position aligned with the sun than when the sun is westward of said position.
