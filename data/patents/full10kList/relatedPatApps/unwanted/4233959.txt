Thermal energy storage apparatus has a heat-insulating casing containing a length of flexible material extending between a pair of driven mandrels so that the material can be wound on either mandrel selectively. Between the mandrels the unwound material is heated as it passes a window in the casing through which solar energy is focused, and the heated material is collected in closely coiled form on the receiving mandrel, where it has a low exposed surface area for its thermal mass, to store the heat received. The stored energy is extracted from the coiled material by winding it onto the other mandrel while a gas flow is passed over the unwound material.
