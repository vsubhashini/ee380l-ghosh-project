A solar furnace apparatus including a reflector portion, a collector portion and a fluid transfer portion; the reflector portion including a generally dish-shaped reflective member, the reflective member having a conic section configuration with a large open face and a highly reflective internal surface, the collector portion being disposed at the focal point of the reflective member, the collector portion including a chamber formed of a plurality of concave longitudinal sections and therewith forming an enclosed chamber, inlet and outlet members communicating with the chamber, the fluid transfer portion including a conduit member connected to the inlet and outlet members of the collector portion and mechanism associated with said conduit member for circulating fluid to heat storage or heat dissipating members.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar furnace apparatus including a reflector portion, a collector portion and a fluid transfer portion, said reflector portion including a generally dish-shaped reflective member, said reflective member having a conic section configuration with a large open face and a highly reflective internal surface, said collector portion being disposed along the axis of and at the focal point of said reflective member, said collector portion including a chamber formed of a plurality of concave longitudinal conductive metal sections joined at their edges, the cross section of said longitudinal sections forming a generally star-shaped configuration, said concave longitudinal sections being disposed substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of said reflective member, end sections affixed to the free edges of said concave longitudinal sections and therewith forming an enclosed chamber, a central conduit means extending from one of said end sections to a point adjacent the other end section but spaced therefrom, a plurality of discrete longitudinal baffle means disposed within said chamber around said central conduit means, inlet and outlet means communicating with said chamber, the distance across the cross section of said collector portion being less than the length of said concave longitudinal sections thereof, mounting means for the securing of said collector portion adjacent the apex of said reflective member, said fluid transfer portion including conduit means connected to said inlet and outlet means of said collector portion and means associated with said conduit means for circulating fluid to a heat storage or heat dissipating means. 2. A solar furnace apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said collector portion is spaced from said reflective member a distance less than the length of the concave longitudinal sections of said collector portion. 3. A solar furnace apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said reflective member is formed with a single surface. 4. A solar furnace apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said collector member includes internal fins.
