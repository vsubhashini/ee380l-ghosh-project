A heat actuable directing device suitable for directing a member such as a solar energy collection device to more favored dispositions with respect to the source of heat which actuates the device. The device itself consists of the member to be directed, a fluid container positioned so as to receive more heat from the source of heat when the member to be directed is at a less favorable disposition than it would if at its more favored disposition, a fluid actuable force applying means associated with the member capable of moving the member from a less favored disposition to a more favored disposition with respect to the source of heat and a fluid tight conduit means operatively connecting said fluid container and said fluid actuable force applying means so as to convey fluid pressure increases from the container to the force applying means to thus move said member to be directed to said more favored disposition whenever necessary.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar heat actuable directing device comprising a pivotally mounted member to be directed to a more favourable disposition with respect to the sun as the sun moves during the day time, said member having associated therewith solar energy collection means, a fluid container in a constant relationship with said member to be directed, shield means statically associated with said fluid container arranged to shield said container from said sun when said member to be directed is at its most favoured disposition with respect to the sun but which permits sunlight to reach said container when said member to be directed has fallen behind the movement of the sun, fluid actuable ram means associated with said member to be directed capable of moving said member about its pivotal mounting from a less favoured disposition to a more favoured disposition with respect to said sun upon receiving an appropriate modified fluid pressure caused by changes in the amount of heat from the sun being received by said fluid container, and fluid tight conduit means operatively connected between said container and said fluid actuable ram means to convey fluid pressure changes from said container to said fluid actuable ram means. 2. A heat actuable directing device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said fluid is a liquid. 3. A heat actuable directing device as claimed in claim 1 wherein there is provided means to accentuate the heating effect of sunlight on said fluid container when said container is not being shielded by the shield means from the sun so that even minor variations from the most preferred disposition with respect to the sun will cause the said fluid actuable ram means to move.
