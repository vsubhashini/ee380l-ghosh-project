The invention relates to a mounting system consisting of aluminum profiles (1, 11) in which threaded sliding blocks (14) inserted in the profiles are used, in particular, for fastening to solar modules and roof supports. The mounting system comprises at least two spaced apart profiled mounting rails (1) respectively with a support (2) limiting the profile height (7) and a connection (3) below the support (2) for the roof mounting. Threaded sliding blocks (14) are inserted in a form-fitting manner in each profiled mounting rail (1) for fastening the connection with the solar modules and the roof mounts. The profiled mounting rail has additional connecting profiles (4, 5, 6), arranged on the side or on the side and bottom, for engagement with complementary connecting profiles (8, 9, 10) of a profiled connecting rail (11). The profiled mounting rail (1) can be extended by sliding shaped pieces (13) with the profile of the profiled mounting rail (1) onto the profiled connecting rail (1 1).
