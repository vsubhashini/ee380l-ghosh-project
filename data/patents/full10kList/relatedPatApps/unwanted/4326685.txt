A sun-sensing guidance system (10) for high-altitude aircraft (A) characterized by a disk-shaped body (14) mounted for rotation aboard the aicraft in exposed relation to solar radiation and having a plurality of mutually isolated chambers (28a, 28b, 32a, and 32b); each chamber of the plurality being characterized by an opening having a photosensor (34a, 34b, 36a, and 36b) disposed therein and arranged in facing relation with the opening for receiving incident solar radiation and responsively providing a voltage output, said photosensors being connected in paired relation through a bridge circuit (38) for providing heading error signals in response to detected imbalances in intensities of solar radiation incident on the photosensors of either pair of photosensors until a nulled relationship is achieved for the disk (14) to the source of radiation.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a sun-sensing guidance system for high-altitude, unmanned aircraft, the improvement comprising: A. a disk-shaped body adapted to be mounted aboard an aircraft in exposed relation to solar radiation and having defined therein a plurality of mutually isolated chambers, each chamber of said plurality being characterized by an opening and having a photosensor disposed therein and arranged in facing relation with respect to the opening for receiving indicent solar radiation, each photosensor being adapted to provide a photovoltage output in response to incident solar radiation; B. circuit means interconnecting the plurality of photosensors in paired relationship including a wheatstone bridge circuit connected between the photosensors of each pair for providing a voltage output indicative of heading error in response to detected imbalance in the photovoltage output derived from a pair of photosensors; C. mounting means supporting said disk for rotation to a null position wherein the photovoltage output for the photosensors is balanced at said bridge circuit when the aircraft is on course; and D. means for rotating said disk for selecting a course including drive means for imparting rotation to the disk, a ground-based radio signal transmitter circuit and a radio signal receiver circuit mounted on said aircraft and electrically connected with said drive means. 2. In combination with an aircraft, a sun-sensing guidance system the improvement comprising: A. rotatable, disk-shaped body mounted aboard the aircraft in a position to be exposed to direct rays of the sun, said body being characterized by at least two pairs of chambers, each having a photosensor disposed therein and characterized by an opening having a peripherally directed axis for admitting said rays to strike the sensors when the opening faces the sun, the axes of the openings of one pair of chambers being projected in substantially opposite directions and the axes of the openings of the other pair of chambers being projected in substantially the same direction and at substantially ninety degrees with respect to the axes of said one pair of openings whereby the sensors of said one pair of chambers are precluded from simultaneously assuming a position facing the sun and the sensors of the other pair of chambers may be caused simultaneously to assume a position facing the sun; B. means for masking the photosensors of said one pair of chambers relative to the sun when the sensors of said other pair of chambers are in a position facing the sun; and C. means for rotationally displacing said body for simultaneously repositioning the sensors of said one pair of chambers to a masked position and the sensors of the pair to a position simultaneously to the sun. 3. The improvement of claim 2 wherein the rays of the sun are incident on only one photosensor when either opening of said one pair is caused to face the sun, and said means for displacing said body includes a motor connected in driving relation to said body, means for controlling said motor including a ground-based radio signal transmitter and an aircraft based radio signal receiver tuned to said transmitter and connected to said motor for controlling the operation thereof. 4. The improvement of claim 3 wherein said transmitter includes manually operable course selection control means characterized by an arcuate scale bearing indicia indicative of the diurnal positions of the sun relative to the aircraft, a pointer mounted on the scale and adapted to be moved therealong for marking an instantaneous diurnal position of the sun relative to the aircraft, a disk-shaped rotatable compass card concentrically related to said scale bearing indicia said indicia being indicative of compass heading and repositionable to an aligned relation with said pointer, and a rotatable transmitter circuit control knob having a position marker defined on the face thereof concentrically related to said compass card and adapted to be rotated for repositioning said indicia relative to said compass card for initiating transmission of a signal from said transmitter circuit to be received by said radio signal receiver for thereby causing said body to be displaced for repositioning said chamber relative to the sun.
