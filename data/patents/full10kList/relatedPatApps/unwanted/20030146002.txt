An oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. Heat may be applied to the formation from one or more heat sources to raise a temperature of a portion of the formation to a desired temperature. Hydrocarbons, H.sub.2, and/or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Some or all of the sources may be removable from the formation during and/or after use.
