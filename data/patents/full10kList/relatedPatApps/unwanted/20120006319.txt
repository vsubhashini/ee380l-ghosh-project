A solar collector (1) is provided having a cover (200), a back wall (300), and an absorber (100), the absorber being arranged between the cover (200) and the back wall (300) and defining, with the cover (200) and/or the back wall (300), a front and/or back cavity (14, 15), respectively. At least one spacer element (400) is provided, which extends from a front surface (102) of the absorber (100) to the cover (200) and/or from a back surface (103) of the absorber (100) to the back wall (300) and is connected or connectable directly to the absorber (100) and/or the cover (200). A method for manufacturing such a solar collector (1) is also provided.
Claims 1.-12. (canceled) 13. A solar collector comprising a cover, a back wall, an absorber arranged between the cover and the back wall, the absorber together with the cover and/or the back wall defining a respective front and/or back cavity, and at least one spacer element extending from a front surface of the absorber to the cover and/or from a back surface of the absorber to the back wall and being connected or connectable directly to the absorber and/or the cover. 14. The solar collector according to claim 13, wherein the spacer element has a pin-shaped construction. 15. The solar collector according to claim 13, wherein the spacer element has a mounting region connected or connectable directly to the absorber. 16. The solar collector according to claim 15, wherein the mounting region comprises an end face of the spacer element. 17. The solar collector according to claim 16, wherein the end face is an axial end face of the spacer element. 18. The solar collector according to claim 15, wherein the mounting region comprises a peripheral sub-face of the spacer element. 19. The solar collector according to claim 15, wherein the spacer element comprises at least one clamp or tensioner which borders the mounting region. 20. The solar collector according to claim 13, wherein the absorber comprises an absorber sheet and/or an absorber tube, which is connected or connectable directly to the spacer element. 21. The solar collector according to claim 20, wherein the mounting region forms a rail-shaped profile, which is connected or connectable to the absorber tube. 22. The solar collector according to claim 20, wherein the mounting region forms a C-shaped profile, which is clamped or clampable to the absorber tube. 23. The solar collector according to claim 15, wherein the mounting region comprises a groove, which engages around a side surface of the absorber. 24. The solar collector according to claim 23, wherein the groove engages around a side surface of the absorber sheet. 25. The solar collector according to claim 13, wherein the spacer element is connected to the absorber by at least one of bonding, fusing, screwing, and press-bonding. 26. The solar collector according to claim 13, wherein the solar collector has a frame-less construction. 27. A method for manufacturing a solar collector according to claim 13, the method comprising connecting at least one spacer element to an absorber, and arranging the absorber between the back wall and the cover, such that the absorber has a spacing to the back wall and/or to the cover, wherein the spacing is defined by a length of the spacer element.
