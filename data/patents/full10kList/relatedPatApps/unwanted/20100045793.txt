The system according to claim 1, wherein the shock absorbing facility monitoring apparatus includes: an approach recognition unit for recognizing approach of the vehicle and transmitting the vehicle approach signal when the vehicle approaches within a predetermined distance; an approach monitoring unit for outputting the vehicle approach signal and a photographing control signal when the vehicle approach signal is received from the approach recognition unit; a photographing unit for photographing an object in response to the photographing control signal of the approach monitoring unit, converting the photographed object into a photograph signal, i.e., an electrical signal, and outputting the photograph signal; a signal processing unit for processing the photograph signal received from the photographing unit into a video signal, transmitting the video signal, and storing the transmitted video signal; and a control box for storing the vehicle approach signal and the video signal received from the approach monitoring unit and the signal processing unit and transmitting the stored vehicle approach and video signals outside through a transmit and receive unit. 3. The system according to claim 2, wherein the shock absorbing facility monitoring apparatus further includes a power supply apparatus provided with a solar cell battery, for supplying voltage charged in the solar cell battery as driving power. 4. The system according to claim 2, wherein the shock absorbing facility monitoring apparatus further includes an interface unit connected to an external apparatus, for transmitting the vehicle approach and video signals from the control box to the external apparatus. 5. The system according to claim 1, further comprising a control box monitoring apparatus installed on a top of the control box, for photographing the control box, converting a photographed signal to a control box breakdown monitoring signal, and storing the control box breakdown monitoring signal. 6. The system according to claim 1, wherein the central control apparatus includes: a transmit and receive unit for receiving the vehicle approach and video signals transmitted from the shock absorbing facility monitoring apparatuses; a control unit for storing the vehicle approach and video signals, displaying the vehicle approach and video signals on a screen, and transmitting an acknowledge message to a terminal of a corresponding manager; a storage unit for storing the vehicle approach and video signals by the shock absorbing facility monitoring apparatus in response to a control of the control unit; and a mobile communication unit for transmitting the acknowledge message to the terminal of the manager in response to a control of the control unit. 7. The system according to claim 1, wherein the central control apparatus further includes a wired communication unit for coping with an abnormal situation such as a malfunction of a wireless communication system and allowing the manager to manually check the shock absorbing facility monitoring system for vehicles. 8. The system according to claim 6, wherein the control unit determines whether the shock absorbing facility monitoring apparatus 100 normally operates by transmitting a normal operation confirmation signal to the shock absorbing facility monitoring apparatus 100 at regular intervals and checking whether a response thereof is received. 9. A shock absorbing facility monitoring apparatus for vehicles, the apparatus comprising: a power supply apparatus formed with solar cells, for charging the solar cells by transforming sunlight into an electrical signal and supplying the charged power as driving power; an approach recognition apparatus provided with an infrared sensor or a supersonic sensor, for outputting a vehicle approach signal when the infrared or supersonic sensor senses approach of a vehicle within a predetermined distance; a photographing apparatus connected to the approach recognition apparatus, for photographing the vehicle in response to the vehicle approach signal of the approach recognition apparatus and outputting a corresponding video signal; a control box for receiving and storing the vehicle approach signal outputted from the approach recognition apparatus and the video signal outputted from the photographing apparatus, outputting the stored video signal outside, and transmitting the stored video signal to a mobile terminal connected from outside through intercommunication with the mobile terminal; and a control box monitoring apparatus installed on a top of the control box, for monitoring the control box in real time.
