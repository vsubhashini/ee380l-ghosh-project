A proximity light is provided and consists of a housing adhesively mounted to a flat surface such as a wall or the underside of a toilet seat cover. An electrically operated light source is carried within the housing along with electronic circuitry for supplying electric current to energize the light source. A sensor switch is also carried within the housing and is connected between the electronic circuitry and the light source so as to close when it gets dark.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A proximity light comprising: (a) a housing; (b) means for mounting said housing to a flat surface; (c) an electrically operated light source carried within said housing; (d) means carried within said housing, for supplying electric current to energize said light source; and (e) a sensor switch carried within said housing and connected between said supplying means and said light source so as to close when it gets dark; further including a gravity operated mercury switch connected between said light source and said supplying means so that when said housing is mounted on the flat surface in a vertical position, said mercury switch will close. 2. A proximity light as recited in claim 1, wherein said housing includes a base member with a transparent cover. 3. A proximity light as recited in claim 2, wherein said mounting means in a layer of adhesive material between the back of said base member and the flat surface. 4. A proximity light as recited in claim 3, wherein said light source includes an electric lamp contained within a socket . 5. A proximity light as recited in claim 4, wherein said supplying means includes: (a) a battery for supplying the electric current to said socket with said electric lamp; (b) a battery charger connected to said battery; and (c) solar cells connected to said battery charger for operating said battery charger to recharge said battery.
