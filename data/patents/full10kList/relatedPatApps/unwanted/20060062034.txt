Apparatus for conditioning power generated by an energy source includes an inverter for converting a DC input voltage from the energy source to a square wave AC output voltage, and a converter for converting the AC output voltage from the inverter to a sine wave AC output voltage.
Claims 1. Apparatus for conditioning power generated by an energy source, comprising: an inverter for converting a first DC input voltage to a first AC output voltage; a first converter for converting said first AC output voltage from said inverter to a second AC output voltage. 2. The apparatus as defined in claim 1, wherein said first AC output voltage comprises a high frequency square wave AC output voltage and said second AC output voltage comprises a sine wave AC output voltage. 3. The apparatus as defined in claim 2, wherein said inverter comprises a plurality of switches that are turned on and off at a predetermined duty pulse to generate said high frequency square wave AC output voltage. 4. The apparatus as defined in claim 2, wherein said converter is sine wave modulated to generate said sine wave AC output voltage. 5. The apparatus as defined in claim 1, further comprising: a second converter for increasing said a voltage output by the energy source to said first DC input voltage. 6. The apparatus as defined in claim 5, wherein energy source comprises at least one fuel cell (FC). 7. The apparatus as defined in claim 5, wherein said second converter comprises a coupled inductor for generating DC current and AC current in said first output voltage for generating a substantially ripple free current associated with said first DC input voltage. 8. The apparatus as defined in claim 1, wherein said energy source comprises a photovoltaic array. 9. The apparatus as defined in claim 1, further comprising an active power filter connected to input of said first converter for reducing a low frequency ripple current in said first DC input voltage.
