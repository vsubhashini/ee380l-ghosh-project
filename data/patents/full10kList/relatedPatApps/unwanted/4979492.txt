A solar ray collecting device including a supporting rod supported at its lower end by a rotating mechanism and carrying in its upper portion a horizontal supporting shaft is described. The supporting shaft intersects the supporting rod at a right angle and rotatably supports the mounting plates having a large number of solar ray collecting elements arranged thereon. A larger part of the solar ray collecting elements are mounted on a front mounting plate positioned in front of the supporting rod and the supporting shaft and the rest of the solar collecting elements are mounted on a mounting plate positioned behind the supporting rod and the supporting shaft. A supporting frame has a groove for allowing the supporting rod to permit the revolving of said frame.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar ray collecting device comprising a supporting rod supported at its lower end by a rotating mechanism and carrying in its upper portion a horizontal supporting shaft, said supporting shaft intersecting said supporting rod at a right angle and rotatably supporting a frame means having mounting plates, a plurality of solar ray collecting elements arranged on said mounting plates, one of said plurality of mounting plates being a front mounting plate positioned in front of said supporting rod and said supporting shaft, another of said plurality of mounting plates being a rear mounting plate positioned to the rear of said supporting rod and said supporting shaft, some of said solar ray collecting elements being mounted on said front mounting plate and at least a part of the rest of said solar ray collecting elements being mounted on said rear mounting plate, said frame having a groove which receives said supporting rod to permit said frame to revolve about said supporting shaft.
