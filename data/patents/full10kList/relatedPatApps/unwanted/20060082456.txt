An alarm apparatus for detecting an intrusion or compromise situation upon critical equipment or private areas. The apparatus detects an unauthorized radio transmitter (like a wireless camera), or the covering of a critical piece of equipment. Fiber optics, solar cells and special radio antennas are used to detect intrusion remotely and a delay timer will allow normal activity to occur, while reducing false alarms. This alarm apparatus will notify an existing system of the intrusion or compromise when limits are exceeded. This alarm apparatus also addresses privacy concerns of wireless cameras and recording devices in areas like changing rooms, bathrooms, or boardrooms. The apparatus addresses security issues for critical devices like smoke alarms and ATM machines.
Claims 1. An alarm apparatus including: at least one light detector and at least one delay timer. 2. The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said light detector uses a fiber optic cable to monitor light. 3. The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said light detector uses a photo-sensitive material to monitor light. 4. The apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said photo-sensitive material may be a solar cell. 5. An alarm apparatus including: at least one radio frequency detector and at least one delay timer. 6. The apparatus according to claim 4 wherein said radio frequency detector uses a coax cable and antenna to monitor radio frequency activity.
