An electric pulse counter for counting and recording the number of insects killed in a commercial insect electrocutor through an on-site field server is disclosed. The pulse counter is configured of field servers 100, an internet 40, an administrative computer 60, and user terminals 50. An insect electrocutor 20 is positioned near each of the field servers 100 for attracting insects present in the agricultural region and killing them by electrical discharge. An electromagnetic detection coil 10 is disposed above or around the insect electrocutor 20 for detecting changes in the electromagnetic field caused by such electrical discharges. An AC signal converter circuit 30 is disposed in each field server 100 and connected to the lead wire of the corresponding electromagnetic detection coil 10 for generating a digital count pulse from the signal outputted by the electromagnetic detection coil 10. The count pulse is accumulated in a storage unit 4 in the field server and the accumulated value is transmitted to the administrative computer 60 in response to a request therefrom. The administrative computer 60 functions as a Web server to provide this data to users via the Internet.
