An outdoor umbrella includes a foldable umbrella awning, an umbrella frame, a lighting system mounted on the umbrella frame, and a solar power supply arrangement which converts solar energy into electrical energy and provides the converted electrical energy to the lighting system for lighting up the lighting system. The solar power supply arrangement includes a solar collecting device supported by the main supporting stem, wherein the solar collecting device has a collecting surface arranged to expose to sunlight for extensively collecting solar energy.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An outdoor umbrella, comprising: an umbrella awning; an umbrella frame comprising a main supporting stem and an awning frame supporting said umbrella awning to define a shielding zone under said umbrella awning; a lighting system which comprises one or more illuminating units mounted on said awning frame for providing illumination to said shielding zone; and a solar power supply arrangement comprising a solar collecting device having a collecting surface positioned above said shielding zone for exposing in sunlight to collect solar energy, wherein said solar collecting device is electrically connected to said lighting system for converting said solar energy into electrical energy so as to provide said electrical energy to said lighting system; wherein said umbrella frame further comprises a connecting arm, having two longitudinal mounting slots at two sides thereof, pivotally and inclinedly extended from a top portion of said main supporting stem to said upper housing of said awning frame to substantially support said awning frame, wherein said solar collecting device comprises two sliding guiders extended downwardly to slidably mounted along said two mounting slots of said connecting arm to securely mount said solar collecting device along said connecting arm that said collecting surface of said solar collecting device is inclinedly orientated for facing towards sunlight to collect said solar energy, wherein said lighting system further comprises a plurality of electrical wires extended along said awning supporting arms respectively to electrically connect to said illumination units such that said illumination units are spacedly aligned along said awning supporting arms for providing illumination to said shielding zone. 2. The outdoors umbrella, as recited in claim 1, wherein each of said awning supporting arms has a light receiving slot formed along a bottom side thereof to receive said respective electrical wire such that said illumination units are spacedly embedded in said awning supporting arms within said light receiving slots thereof. 3. The outdoors umbrella, as recited in claim 2, wherein said awning supporting arms are pivotally connected to said upper housing in such a manner that said awning supporting arms are adapted to move between a folded position and an unfolded position, wherein at said folded position, said awning supporting arms are pivotally and inwardly folded to overlappedly lay in position, and at said unfolded position, said awning supporting arms are pivotally and outwardly extended to maximize said shielding zone under said umbrella awning.
