An integrated power and attitude control system and method for a vehicle efficiently supplies electrical power to both low voltage and high voltage loads, and does not rely on relatively heavy batteries to supply power during the vehicle initialization process. The system includes an energy storage flywheel, and a solar array that is movable between a stowed position and a deployed position. The energy storage flywheel is spun up, using electrical power supplied from a low voltage power source, to a rotational speed sufficient to provide attitude control. Then, after the solar array is moved to its deployed position, the energy storage flywheel is spun up, using electrical power supplied from a second power source, to a rotational speed sufficient to provide both attitude control and energy storage.
