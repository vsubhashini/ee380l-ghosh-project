A roof in which an upper-end engaging portion of a downstream roof panel is seam-jointed with a lower-end engaging portion of an upstream roof panel, wherein at least the lower-end engaging portion has flexural rigidity enough to disengage the seam joint.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A roof mounting method comprising the steps of: mounting two adjacent combination solar battery and roof panels on a joint drip plate having an opening portion; electrically connecting the two adjacent combination solar battery and roof panels in the opening portion; and placing a keep plate and a joint cover on the joint drip plate and roof panels. 2. A roof mounting method according to claim 1, further comprising the step of providing each combination solar battery and roof panel with a junction box for drawing power out of a solar battery element fixed on the combination solar battery and roof panel. 3. A roof mounting method according to claim 2, further comprising the step of providing a collector electrode on the solar battery element, with a longitudinal direction of the collector electrode being parallel to a longitudinal direction of the roof panel. 4. A roof mounting method according to claim 2, further comprising the step of providing a buffer member higher than the junction box on a back surface of the roof panel. 5. A roof mounting method according to claim 2, further comprising the step of providing the solar battery element with a non-monocrystal semiconductor.
