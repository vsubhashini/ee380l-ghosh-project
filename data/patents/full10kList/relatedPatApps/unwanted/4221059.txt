A box-shaped housing has side and end walls together with a back wall, leaving an opening at its front. A cover of material transparent to sunlight removably closes the front. Inside are a plurality of shelves mounted so as to be tilted at an angle with respect to the end walls. The housing is supported in a stationary position with its back wall tilted backwardly from the top so as to orient the removable shelves substantially in a horizontal position. A plurality of apertures in the housing enable air flow upwardly therethrough.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar food dryer comprising: a box-shaped housing having a pair of mutually space-opposed side walls, a pair of mutually space-opposed end walls individually joining respective end margins of said side walls, a back wall the peripheral margins of which are joined with the corresponding rear margins of said side and end walls to close the rear of said housing and the forward margins of said side and end walls defining an opening extending substantially across the front of said housing, with the material of said walls being substantially opaque to sunlight; a cover dimensioned to span said opening and of a material substantially transparent to sunlight; means for securing said cover in removable closing relationship to said opening; a plurality of shelves each of a width substantially spanning the distance between said side walls and of a depth to span substantially the distance between said rear and forward margins of said side walls when tilted at a predetermined angle with respect to said end walls; means for removably mounting said shelves within said housing in spaced succession between said end walls with each shelf tilted at said angle; means for supporting said housing in a stationary position with said rear wall tilted backwardly from its top to orient said shelves substantially in a horizontal position; means defining apertures in said housing for enabling air flow upwardly therethrough when said housing is in said stationary position, said defining means establishing a first plurality of apertures distributed in said side walls with individual different one thereof being adjacent to respective different ones of said shelves and a second plurality of apertures distributed in the one of said end walls uppermost when said housing is in said stationary position, and said apertures being so distributed and having a total cross-sectional area of an amount enabling a flow of said air at a rate limiting the temperature within said housing, with said cover in said closing relationship and exposed to direct sunlight, to a minimum value of approximately one hundred-forty degrees Fahrenheit; screening disposed across said apertures and of a mesh transmissive of air flow but protective against the passage of insects, said screening being in the form of a continuous layer of mesh material; an inner wall of said housing disposed to sandwich said mesh material against the inner surfaces of said side walls; and said mounting means including elongated lugs projecting integrally from said inner wall into the interior of said housing. 2. A dryer as defined in claim 1 in which said securing means includes mutually-facing U-shaped slots integrally formed in the forward marginal portions of said side walls, said inner wall having its forward marginal portions individually being folded into respective one of said slots. 3. A solar food dryer comprising: a box-shaped housing having a pair of mutually space-opposed side walls, a pair of mutually space-opposed end walls individually joining respective end margins of said side walls, a back wall the peripheral margins of which are joined with the corresponding rear margins of said side and end walls to close the rear of said housing and the forward margins of said side and end walls defining an opening extending substantially across the front of said housing, with the material of said walls being substantially opaque to sunlight; a cover dimensioned to span said opening and of a material substantially transparent to sunlight; means for securing said cover in removable closing relationship to said opening; a plurality of shelves each of a width substantially spanning the distance between said side walls and of a depth to span substantially the distance between said rear and forward margins of said side walls when tilted at a predetermined angle with respect to said end walls; means for removably mounting said shelves within said housing in spaced succession between said end walls with each shelf tilted at said angle; means for supporting said housing in a stationary position with said rear wall tilted backwardly from its top to orient said shelves substantially in a horizontal position; means defining apertures in said housing for enabling air flow upwardly therethrough when said housing is in said stationary position, said defining means establishing a first plurality of apertures distributed in said side walls with individual different ones thereof being adjacent to respective different ones of said shelves and a second plurality of apertures distributed in the one of said end walls uppermost when said housing is in said stationary position, and said apertures being so distributed and having a total cross-sectional area of an amount enabling a flow of said air at a rate limiting the temperature within said housing, with said cover in said closing relationship and exposed to direct sunlight, to a maximum value of approximately one hundred-forty degrees Fahrenheit; each of said shelves being formed to define a plurality of air passages distributed throughout the shelves; and each of said shelves being formed of a first plurality of webs individually spaced successively in the direction of said width and a second plurality of webs individually spaced successively in the direction of said depth, said first and second pluralities of webs mutually intersecting to define an array of air passages.
