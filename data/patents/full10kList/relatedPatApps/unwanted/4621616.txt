Five concentric annular conical beam concentrators mounted above a black-water heat-transfer tank through which domestic household water circulates in tubes. The conical beam concentrators receive convergent conical incipient beams of diffused sunlight and emit concentrated annular beams into the black water. The black water absorbs the heat of the beams and transfers the heat to the tubes through which the domestic water circulates. The panel is designed for use in cloudy overcast areas which receive little direct sunlight during the winter months.
Claims I claim: 1. An annular solar panel comprising five concentric annular conical beam concentrators (1 through 5), a black-water heat-collection heat-transfer tank (6), and tubes (15) through which domestic household water circulates; each conical beam concentrator (1 through 5) having a convex conical section (7) which receives and transmits a convergent conical incipient beam (8) of diffused solar radiation and having a concave conical section (9) which refracts and emits beam (8), forming a concentrated annular beam (9), black-water tank (6) comprising a cylindrical wall (12), a base (13) and a plate-glass cover window (14) serving as mounting platform for conical beam concentrators (1 through 5), and tubes (15) comprising conduits submerged in black-water tank (6).
