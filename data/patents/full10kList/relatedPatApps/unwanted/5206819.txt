Disclosed is a solar heating system including solar collectors through which a heat transfer medium is circulated by a pump between the solar collectors and a reservoir. Temperature sensors monitor the temperature of the heat transfer medium and the temperature of the environment of the system. The electronic output signals from the sensors represent these temperatures, but these signals "drift." A sunlight sensor monitors the intensity of the sunlight and provides electronic output signals representing sunlight intensity. The signal from the sunlight sensor also "drifts." To compensate for signal drift an equilibrium curve for the collectors is employed. A controller for the system has a memory element in which is stored data representing the equilibrium curve for the collector means. This curve enables the controller based on the electronic output from the sensors to determine if the collectors can gain or lose heat. The controller operates the pump in accordance with a predetermined program which relates pump operation to the ability of the collectors to either gain or lose heat as predicted by the equilibrium curve. The curve is adjusted periodically based on temperature and sunlight measurements.
