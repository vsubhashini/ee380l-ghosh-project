Panels are formed and mounted in an exterior structure covering assemblage exteriorly simulating a standard exterior structure covering panel assemblage while simultaneously providing a fluid flow network within the panel assemblage for solar heat collection while not substantially disturbing the standard panel assemblage simulation. Generally, the panels have a relatively thin, freely heat transferring exterior layer portion with directly underlying fluid flow channels interconnected between panels for the overall assemblage fluid flow network without substantially disturbing the exterior standard panel simulation. The panels may be formed to simulate any standard roofing or siding panels and the solar heat collecting assemblage may be integrated with adjacent panel assemblages not including the solar heat collecting features with the overall assemblage still maintaining the same standard panel simulation.
