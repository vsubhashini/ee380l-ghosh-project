A solar ray energy radiating device for use in medical treatment. The device comprises an upper plate having a hole through which the light-emitting end of an optical conductor cable is inserted at the approximate central portion of the upper plate, a diffused reflecting type liquid-crystal plate being disposed so as to oppose the light-emitting end of the optical conductor cable, and a frame body for unitarily mounting thereon the upper plate and the diffused reflecting type liquid-crystal plate. The light ray energy passing through the liquid-crystal plate is controlled by changing the voltage applied thereto.
Claims I claim: 1. A solar ray energy radiating device for use in medical treatment, said device comprising an upper plate having a hole through which the light-emitting end of an optical conductor cable is inserted at the approximate central portion of said upper plate, said optical conductor cable carrying light ray energy, a diffused reflecting type liquid-crystal plate being disposed so as to oppose said light-emitting end of said optical conductor cable, a frame body for unitarily mounting thereon said upper plate and said diffused reflecting type liquid-crystal plate, a light sensor for detecting the light ray energy radiated from said optical conductor cable, said light sensor being installed at the outside of said diffused reflecting type liquid-crystal plate, and a variable voltage source connected to said liquid-crystal plate for controlling the diffusivity of said liquid-crystal plate thereby controlling the amount of the light ray energy passing through said liquid-crystal plate, the voltage applied by said variable voltage source to said liquid-crystal plate being changed in accordance with the output signal generated by said light sensor. 2.
