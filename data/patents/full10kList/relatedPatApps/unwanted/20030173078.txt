An oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. Hydrocarbons, H.sub.2, and/or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Heat may be applied to the formation to raise a temperature of a portion of the formation to a pyrolysis temperature. Heat input into the formation may be controlled to maintain a temperature below about a maximum selected temperature.
