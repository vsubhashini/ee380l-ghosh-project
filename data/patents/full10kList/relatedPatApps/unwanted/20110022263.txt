System in accordance with claim 1 where said system will include a GIPS signal input (6) connected to the means for processing the signal (1), in a way that will detect if movement is present. 3. System in accordance with claim 1, which includes means for providing electrical power that may vary depending on the type of vehicle or machine the system is installed in; these electrical power provision means may be selected among the following: photovoltaic cells; wind generator; use of vibrations by electromagnetic generation (faraday's law). 4. System in accordance with claim 1 where the means for detecting the type of driving (10), also include means for detecting the type of driving (10) with said means connected and distributed in a bus (23) that directly connects the means for detecting the type of driving (10) with the means for processing the signal (1); and where said means are configured for providing the data obtained to the signal processing means (1) in such a way to establish a degree of danger for driving and the inherent risk level for driving, displaying this information to the user in the means for displaying this information (16). 5. Method for monitoring the status and driving of a vehicle characterized because it includes at least an analysis stage of the signals originating from the means for detecting the type of driving (10); in such a way, that combining the information from said means with the vehicle's normal speed and acceleration characteristics, we can now the level of hazard associated with the driving in accordance with predefined limits; 6. Method in accordance with claim 5 characterized because it also includes a second stage of acquiring the data regarding the weather condition and the condition of the road in such a way that establishes a degree of danger or smoothness for driving, taking into account the specific aspects of the vehicle as well as the external aspects such as the road, layout and weather conditions. 7. Method in accordance with claim 5 characterized because when the vehicle or machine begins to vibrate, the means for detecting vibrations (2) are triggered and the system waits a time indicated by the timing regulation means (4) and where once this time has elapsed, the system considers the vehicle or machine to be running; and because when the vehicle or machine stops vibrating, the system will wait the time required as set by the time regulator (4) and will consider the engine to be shutdown. 8. Method in accordance with claim 5 characterized because it includes a stage for connection with the vehicle configured for disabling the vehicle or limit its speed from the vehicles central control in the case that risky behaviour is detected. 9. Method in accordance with claim 5 characterized because it includes a stage for acquiring the variables originating from the vehicle. 10. Method in accordance with claim 5 characterized because it includes a stage for acquiring the distance to other vehicles that are located nearby in front, behind or to its side; being configured for combining this data to offer predictions regarding risk for driving. 11. Method in accordance with claim 5 characterized because it includes a stage for recording the information as a buffer and sending this information to third parties. 12. Method in accordance with claim 5 characterized because it includes a stage for assigning the variables of vehicle skid or turnover index, in a way that the device knows if the vehicle in question is in a danger zone and warns the driver of his risky situation. 13. Method in accordance with claim 5 characterized because it includes a stage for combining the data regarding movement and speed with a map that indicates the radius of the curve and provide a forewarning that the vehicle is going too fast take the curve before it reaches the curve and in this way preventing a possible turnover or skidding of the vehicle, combining the speed of the vehicle with the radius of the map curve, the vehicles characteristics and its limits for safely driving through curves. 14. Method in accordance with claim 5 characterized because by knowing the speed of the vehicle and the curve that must be taken, by means of the routes provided by the navigation means, it can be anticipated and may offer a degree of safety in the manoeuvre because if the vehicle is travelling at an excessive speed it may even offer a different route and does not take into account the prior route, while parallel to this, it warns the driver of the danger involved with carrying out the manoeuvre.
