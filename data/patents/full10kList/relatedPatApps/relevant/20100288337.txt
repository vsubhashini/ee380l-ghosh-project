The present invention includes a solar panel mounting system. The system comprises a first row of a plurality of generally horizontal first bases. The system also includes a second row of a plurality of generally horizontal second bases and a third row of a plurality of generally horizontal third bases. Each of the first bases, second bases and third bases have a short pair of upwardly extending legs affixed to one side of the base and a long pair of upwardly extending legs affixed to the other side. Each of the first bases, second bases and third bases are generally configured to be stacked on top of other of the first bases, second bases and third bases, such that the each of the bases abut against the other of the bases and the respective short pair of legs and the long pair legs of each of the bases fit offset from and adjacent to the respective short pair and long pair of the other of the bases.
Claims 1. A solar panel mounting system, comprising: a first row of a plurality of generally horizontal first bases; a second row of a plurality of generally horizontal second bases; a third row of a plurality of generally horizontal third bases; wherein each of the first bases, second bases and third bases have a short pair of upwardly extending legs affixed to one side of the base and a long pair of upwardly extending legs affixed to the other side, and wherein each of the first bases, second bases and third bases are generally configured to be stacked on top of other of the first bases, second bases and third bases, such that the each of the bases abut against the other of the bases and the respective short pair of legs and the long pair legs of each of the bases fit offset from and adjacent to the respective short pair and long pair of the other of the bases; a one row of frames supportably affixed to solar panels, the first row of frames have a front side and a back side; wherein the front side of the one row of frames is affixed to and supported by the short pair of legs of the first row of a plurality of generally horizontal first bases, and wherein the back side of the one row of frames is affixed to and supported by the long pairs of the second row of second bases; a back row of frames supportably affixed to solar panels, the back row of frames have a front side and a back side; wherein the front side of the back row of frames is affixed to and supported by the short pair of legs of the second row of a plurality of generally horizontal second bases, and wherein the back side of the back row of frames is affixed to and supported by the long pair of legs of the third row of a plurality of generally horizontal second bases, wherein the third base is positioned directly beneath the back row of frames.
