A replaceable photovoltaic inverter is mounted on each of a plurality of photovoltaic module for the conversion of direct current, produced by the photovoltaic cells, to alternating current. The inverter is coupled to a mounting bracket on the photovoltaic module such that is can be easily replaced. Replacement of an individual photovoltaic module inverter can occur during continuous operation of the photovoltaic module system with minimal impact on overall power production. The inverter is also mounted apart from the photovoltaic module to facilitate heat transfer generated by operation of the inverter.
Claims 1. Apparatus for coupling power generated by a photovoltaic (PV) module to an output, comprising a mounting bracket comprising: a plurality of electrical receptacles for electrically coupling an inverter to the mounting bracket without any external wiring; a locking clip for locking the inverter to the mounting bracket; a DC connection from a DC output of the PV module to a first subset of electrical receptacles of the plurality of electrical receptacles for providing DC power from the PV module to the inverter; and at least one AC connector, coupled to a second subset of electrical receptacles, for receiving AC power from the inverter. 2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the plurality of electrical receptacles are recessed into the mounting bracket. 3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the mounting bracket retains the inverter such that the inverter is physically spaced apart from the PV module.
