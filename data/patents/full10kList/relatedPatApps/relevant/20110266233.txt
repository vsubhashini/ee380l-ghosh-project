Mounting system (1) for solar modules (6), having a substructure (7, 9, 11) on which a frame (2) is supported on which one or more plate-shaped solar modules (6) are held, and having an anchor (13, 35) that can be affixed to a building structure and supports the frame (2) in an upper region, wherein a retainer part (20, 50'') is provided at the anchor (13, 35) in order to fix the frame (2) and being adjustable to alter the inclination relative to the anchor (13, 35) by at least one axis.
Claims 1. Mounting system for solar modules (6), having a substructure (7, 9, 11) on which a frame (2) is supported on which one or more plate-shaped solar modules (6) are held, and having an anchor (13, 35) that can be affixed to a building and supports the frame (2) in an upper region, characterized in that a retainer part (20, 50'') is provided at the anchor (13, 35) to fix the frame (2) and being adjustable to alter the inclination relative to the anchor (13, 35) by at least one axis. 2. Mounting system according to claim 1, characterized in that the retainer part (20, 50'') relative to the anchor (13, 35) is adjustable around a horizontal axis. 3. Mounting system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the retainer part (20, 50'') relative to the anchor (13, 35) is adjustable around an essentially vertical axis. 4. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the retainer part (20, 50'') relative to the anchor (13, 35) is adjustable around several axes. 5. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the length of the anchor (13, 35) can be modified in order to adjust the distance between the retainer part (20, 50'') and the wall (17). 6. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the plate-shaped solar modules (6) span a plane that is arranged at a wall (17) of a building and tilted both in a horizontal direction as well as in a vertical direction. 7. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the base part (11) is swivel-mounted to a socket part (9) about a horizontal axis. 8. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that an upwardly extending profile (3) being longitudinally relative to the retainer part (20, 50'') slidably adjustable is attached to the retainer part (20, 50''). 9. Mounting system according to claims 8, characterized in that the retainer part (20, 50'') partially clasps a section of the profile (3).
