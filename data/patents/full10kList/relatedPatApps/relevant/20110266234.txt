A mounting system (1) for solar modules (6) having base part (11) on which a frame (2) is supported to which one or more plate-shaped solar modules (6) are held, and having an anchor (13, 35) capable of being attached to a wall of a building structure and which supports the frame (2) in an upper region, wherein the base part (11) is pivotable about a horizontal axis (10). Further, the invention relates to a method for installing a solar system.
Claims 1. Mounting system (1) for solar modules (6) having a substructure (7,9,11) on which a frame (2) is supported to which one or more plate-shaped solar modules (6) are held, and having an anchor (13, 35) capable of being attached to a building structure and which supports the frame (2) in an upper region, characterized in that the base part (11) is pivotable about a horizontal axis (10) and that the frame (2) can be fixed in various angles of inclination. 2. Mounting system according to claim 1, characterized in that the weight loads of the frame (2) and the solar modules (6) are essentially born by the substructure. 3. Mounting system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the base part (11) is mounted to a stationary part (9) attached at the bottom to a socket or post (7). 4. Mounting system according to claim 3, characterized in that the stationary part (9) and the base part (11) are connected to each other by means of a hinge joint. 5. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the inclination of the frame (2) relative to the horizontal is adjustable by means of the anchor (13, 35) or retainer part (20, 20', 61). 6. Mounting system according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that profiles (3) are positioned longitudinally slidably relative to a retainer part (20) being connected to the anchor (13, 35). 7. Method for installing a solar system having the following steps: Fixing a profile (3) to a base part (11) being stationary at the bottom; Erecting the profile (3) by pivoting about a horizontal axis (10), and Attaching a retainer part (20) in the upper region of the profile (3) and fixing the retainer part (20) by means of an anchor (13, 35) to a building structure. 8. Method according to claim 7, characterized in that several profiles (3) by means of transverse bars (4, 5) are connected to each other in order to form a frame (2) before the profiles (3) are erected. 9. Method according to claim 8, characterized in that the frame (2) is swung into an intermediate position disposed from the ground and supported there in order to at least partially mount the solar modules (6). 10. Method according to claim 9, characterized in that the frame (2) is erected with the solar modules being attached (6).
