A solar tracking system comprising a solar panel, a support base, and a panel mounting section mounted to the support base for rotation about a generally vertical axis of rotation. The panel is mounted to the mounting section to be able to rotate about a generally horizontal secondary panel axis of rotation. There is a panel positioning section comprising a base positioning section and an intermediate positioning section having a rear connecting portion to contact the base connecting region and a forward connecting positioning location to connect to the panel at a forward panel connecting positioning location. The intermediate positioning section has a linking axis extending between the rear connecting positioning location and the panel connecting location. The panel is rotated about the main axis of rotation and the intermediate positioning section changes its angular position relative to the base positioning section to cause the tilt angle of the panel to change to track the sun. The positioning section can have its connecting location(s) adjusted to be adapted to both summer and winter conditions so that it is possible to maintain the panel in the proper orientation.
