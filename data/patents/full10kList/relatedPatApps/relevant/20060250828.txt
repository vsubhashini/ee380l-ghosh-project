An inverter design with makes use of an integrated power module in place of discrete transistors. The use of an integrated power module facilitates the creation of a field replaceable component consisting of the power module and a circuit board with control and other circuitry.
Claims 1. An inverter connected to a photovoltaic panel comprising: a photovoltaic panel, an output of which is DC power; and a set of transistors electrically connected to said photovoltaic panel that controllably convert said DC power into AC power wherein said transistors are contained in an integrated power module. 2. The inverter of claim 1 wherein said integrated power module is attached to a circuit board that also contains control and other circuitry such that said integrated power module and circuit board together form a removable subassembly that is easily removed and replaced in the field. 3. The inverter of claim 1 wherein said integrated power module has a front side with electrical connectors and a back side is a flat heat exchange surface and wherein said inverter further comprises a heat sink wherein said flat heat exchange surface is in contact with said heat sink. 4. The inverter of claim 2 wherein said integrated power module has a front side with electrical connectors and a back side is a flat heat exchange surface and wherein said inverter further comprises a heat sink wherein said flat heat exchange surface is in contact with said heat sink. 5. The inverter of claim 3 wherein said integrated power module is a PowerEx model PM75B4L or PowerEx model PS11037. 6. The inverter of claim 4 wherein said integrated power module is a PowerEx
